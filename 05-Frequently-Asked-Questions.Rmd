**Population Predictive Risk Algorithms** 

Population predictive risk algoithms predict the future risk of a health outcome (e.g. Life Expectancy) using routinely collected health data.

**Applications**

Population predictive risk algorithms can:

- display the projection of new cases
- describe a population's risk (is the risk diffused or concentrated)
- be used for the evaluation of preventative strategies
- be used for individual or population level analysis
- describe risk in sub-populations


**Model generation**

-	Population predictive risk models use routinely collected data that includes information about risk factors (exposure) and health events.
-	Data is collected at an individual level through population health surveys (e.g. Canadian Community Health Survey) and administrative databases (e.g. Vital Statistics). Data sources are then linked at the individual level.

    - Risk Factors, from population health surveys, are self reported; no clinical data (e.g. blood pressure) is collected. Risk factors focus on health behaviours (e.g. smoking) and sociodemographic factors, which are commonly associated with health outcome.
    
    
- Risk models are then developed, evaluated, and validated.

    - Development
            - Risk factors are added into the model using strict criteria.
      
        
    - Evaluation. Models are evaluated through assessing their:
    
ï‚§        - Discrimination: ability of the model to differentiate between individuals with high and low risk
        - Calibration: how well the predicted outcome matches the observed outcome
        
    - Validation. The final model is used on datasets not used in its development: different years of data or data from different populations.
