##Customize Data

Prior to using the Project Big Life Planning Tool you may want to manipulate your dataset. Reasons for data manipulation may include: custom filter or custom stratification. 

Data manipulation can occur on any programming software: R, SAS, STATA, etc, provided you output your dataset as a .csv file. 

The following table shows the applicable R, SAS, STATA code to complete following example:

*To clarify: Not sure whether to continue with this section, as there are multiple ways to manipulate the data. Could provide an example*



##Upload Data 

*To Do: determine what terminology to use Uploaded vs. Imported*

Data *uploaded* to the Project Big Life Planning Tool remains on your computer and is not uploaded or sent anywhere. 

**Note** The Project Big Life Planning Tool can currently only support: data from the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey and '.csv' files.

There are two options for your data: use a sample file or upload your own file. 

###Use a sample file

There are **X** sample files you may use to complete your calculations:

- MockPUMF2013.csv is the Public Use Microdata File from the [2013 Canadian Community Health Survey] (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/82M0013X). 

Click on the file name under the **Sample files** to select it. 

###Upload your own file

Click the browse button under **Select a file to use in calculations**. 
Locate the file on your computer, select, and open. 

If the imported file has all of the variables required and recommended for calculation, you will be able to continue with the planning tool. 

- If the imported file does **not** have all the variables required for the calculation you will not be able to continue with the planning tool.

- If the imported file does **not** have all the variables recommended for calculation you will be able to continue with the planning tool, however the calculations may be less accurate. 



##Select Outcome

Click on box beside the calculation name under **Select initial calculations**.


##Filter Data

(ref:Filter)

Click on the + Add filter button.

Select the variable that you want to filter on. 

*To Clarify: CAT vs. Continous - what are we letting them filter on*

To add another filter repeat the steps above. A maximum of three filters are recommended to maintain statistical power (added filters reduce sample sizes and reduces statistical power). 

You are able to filter on all types of variables: required for calculation, recommended for calculation, and ignore variables (includes customized variables).

###Remove a filter

To remove a filter entirely, click on the trash can beside the filter you want to delete.

To remove a level within a filtered variable, click on the 'x' beside the variable level.



##Stratify Data

Select the variables you want to stratify on Under 'Stratifications'. A maximum of 3 stratifications are recommended to maintain statistical power (added strata reduce strata sample size and reduces statistical power).

You are able to stratify on all types of variables: required for calculation, recommended for calculation, and ignore variables (includes customized variables).


##Calculate Outcomes

Name your calculation to quickly differentiate multiple calculations.

**Note** the larger the data file is the longer the calculations will take. It may take a few minutes for the calculation to complete. *TBD: There has been discussion on changing the current method. Once a method has been selected then Indicate how they know that the calculation is being preformed.*



##Generate Intervention Scenarios

*TBD: How much of it will be included in the platform. Will inform how to write this section*



##Visualize Data

*TBD: Need plots on the platform to work through the steps below*
- export
- create your own(?)



##Export Data

Click on the **Download results** button under the **Results** section.

Select which calculations you'd like to download. 

*To Do: Screenshot of all the calculation options once the platform is fixed.*


##Resolve Warning or Error Messages

*TO DO: confirm with Luke possible error messages and what they mean*

- Invalid category
- Out of range
- Not a number
- Sample Size is too small
