# Applications

This chapter provides you with examples of how Project Big Life's Planning Tool can be used in your day-to-day operations. The examples will cover: cause-deletion, generating a health status report and determining the impact of a local and national policy.

## Cause-deleted life expectancy

What would be the life expectancy of a population if be no one in the population ever smoked? This scenario is a cause-deleted scenario.

**Cause-deleted life expectancy** is the estimated life expectancy of a population if a specific cause (e.g. smoking) did not exist in that population. This population is known as the counterfactual population. 

**Cause-deleted effect of life expectancy** is calculated by comparing the population with the current exposure status of smoking status and pack-years of smoking to a counterfactual population where these two variables are: smoking status = never smoker, and pack-years of smoking = 0. It is measured in life years lost. This calculation can also be preformed with the health outcome: risk of mortality. Further explaination of cause-deleted risk and cause-deleted effect of a risk can be found in key concepts (Chapter \ref(keyconcepts)).

Lets walk through this scenario step-by-step!
