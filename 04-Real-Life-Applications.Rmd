# Applications

This chapter provides you with examples of how Project Big Life's Planning Tool can be used in your day-to-day operations. The examples will cover: cause-deletion, generating a health status report and determining the impact of a local and national policy.

## Cause-deleted life expectancy

What everyone in the population never smoked? This scenario is a cause-deleted scenario.

(ref:causedeleted)

The scenario compares the population with the current exposure status of smoking status and pack-years of smoking to a counterfactual population where these two variables are: smoking status = never smoker, and pack-years of smoking = 0. 

The health outcome life expectancy is calculated for both the current population and it's counterfactual population, and then compared to each other.

The outcome will give you the life-years lost due to smoking. 

Lets walk through this scenario step-by-step!
