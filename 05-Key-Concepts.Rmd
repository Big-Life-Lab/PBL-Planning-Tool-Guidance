##Data and sample files

The Project Big Life Planning Tool currently accepts **2013/2014 Public Use Microdata File and Shared File of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) in '.csv' format.**

###What is the Canadian Community Health Survey?

The CCHS is an annual cross-sectional survey preformed by Statistics Canada. The CCHS collects information related to health status, health care utilization, and health determinants for the Canadian population. Data is shared at the the sub-provincial geographic level (health region or combination of health regions).

- Details about the survey and its design can be found on Statistic Canada website  (http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&Id=144170). 
- Details and access to the Public Use Microdata file (PUMF) can be found through the Odesi website (https://search2.odesi.ca/#/details?uri=%2Fodesi%2Fcchs-82M0013-E-2013-2014-Annual-component.xml)

###Why can I only use the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey data?

Each year the CCHS changes a few variables it captures. This makes CCHS datasets from every year other then 2013/2014 incompatiable with the algorithms used by the Project Big Life Planning Tool.

The Project Big Life Planning Team is currently working to adjust the algorthims so that they accept other CCHS years, and we will update the guidance when we are done.

###Sample Files

- MockPUMF2013.csv is a subsample of the Public Use Microdata File from the [2013 Canadian Community Health Survey] (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/82M0013X). It includes all required and recommended variables: age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, diet components, daily physical activity expenditure, chronic conditions, ethinicity, immigration status, and education.

##Multivariable predictive risk algorithms

Multivariable predictive risk algorithms predict the future risk of health outcomes (e.g. Life Expectancy) for a population using routinely collected health data.

Multivariable predictive risk algorithms can be used to:

- Project the number of new cases of the health outcome
- Estimate the contribution of specific risk factors of the health outcome
- Evaluate effectiveness of health interventions
- Describe the distribution of risk in the population (diffused or concentrated)

Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are able to assess equity issues compared to competing population risk methods (e.g. World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease).

More information on what multivariable predictive risk algorithms are and how they can be used can be found the journal article: *Predictive risk algorithms in a population setting: an overview* [@PoRTover]

###Development of multivariable predictive risk algorithms

__Data:__

-	Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are created using routinely collected data that includes information about risk factors (exposure) and health events (outcomes).
-	Data is collected at an individual level through population health surveys (e.g. Canadian Community Health Survey) and administrative databases (e.g. Vital Statistics). Data sources are linked together when the individual has given permission too.
- Individuals are followed overtime until the health event (e.g. death or disease) occurs.
- Separate data is collected to create a derivation cohort and validation cohort(s). 

    - Note: The risk factors that are collected are from population health surveys and are self-reported; no clinical data (e.g. blood pressure) is collected. Risk factors focus on health behaviours (e.g. smoking) and sociodemographic factors, commonly associated with health outcome.

**Algorithm generation:**

- Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are cox porportional hazard models that analyze time to health outcome (e.g. death) *Question for Carol - The models are not cox-porportional hazard models but they are similar?*

- Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are developed and validated in 4 stages:

    - Algorithm derivation: the predictive risk algorithm is created using data from the derivation cohort
    - Algorithm validation: the predictive risk algorithm is applied to the validation cohort
    - Final algorithm generation: validation and derivation cohorts are combined to estimate the final application of the predictive risk algorithm 
    - Derivation of the application algorithm: creation of a parsimonous (fewer predictors) algorithm that maintained discrimination, calibration, and overall algorithm performance
    
- In each stage of the algorithm development and validation, algorithm performance is assessed using measures of discrimination and calibration.

###Multivariable predictive risk algorithms built in Project Big Life Planning Tool

##Calculations

###Summary vs By Row

There are two general types of calculations Summary Measures and By Row Measures.

Summary measures: (ref:summarycalc)

By row measures: (ref:byrowcalc)

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** Summary Measures are not the same as averaging the By Row Measures. Summary measures account for the master weights in their calculations where as simply averaging the By Row Measures doesn't factor the weights. 
</div>


###Risk of health outcome

Risk of the health outcome (e.g. risk of dying) is the outcome of the multivariable predictive risk algorithm. An example of the mutlivariable risk algorithm is:

$$ \text{Risk} = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$
Where:

- $t$ = survival time
- $h_0(t)$ = the baseline hazard
- $\beta_{pred}$ = predictive hazard ratios for the exposures
- $x$ = the exposure. The exposure can be continous (e.g. age) or categorical. Categorical exposures are represented by dummy/factor variables e.g. smoking status is categorical variable with categories: current, former <= 5 years, former >5 years, or never smoked. Each type of dummy variable with: $x_current smoker$ = 1 if the individual currently smokes or 0 if the individual is another type of smoker).

###Number of health outcomes

The number of health outcomes (e.g. Summary Deaths) is calculated through the following steps:

1. Risk of the health outcome is calculated for each individual in the dataset using the mutlivariable predictive risk algorithm.
2. The weighted mean of all the risks is calculated using individual risk values and corresponding study weights (CCHS variable: WTS_M for the Public Micro Use File or WTS_S for the shared file).
3. The weighted mean is then multiplied with the total number of individuals in the population to generate the number of health outcomes (e.g. number of deaths in 5 years).


###Life expectancy calculation

Life expectancy is calculated using abridge life tables:

1. The mortality risk for each individual is calculated using the mutlivariable predictive risk algorithm for mortality (MPoRT - details can be found in Appendix A).
2. Mortality risks for each individual are weighted using the corresponding survey weights (CCHS variable - WTS_M).
3. Weighted mortality risks are then used in sex-specific 5-year abridge period life tables.
4. Life expectancy was then calculated using these 5-year abridge period life tables. 


##Scenario: Intervention

How would life expectancy change if everyone increased thier physical activity levels by 10%?

The health intervention scenario allows you to predict how changing the health behaviours: alcohol consumption, diet, physical activity, and smoking, of a population will affect the population health outcome (e.g. life expectancy). This feature can be used to predict the effectiveness of proposed policies or programs.

There are three types of scenarios: **absolute, relative,** and **target**.

- **Absolute:** each individual in the population **changes** their health behaviour **by a value of x**. 
- **Relative:** each individual in the population **changes** their health behaviour **by a ratio of y**.
- **Target:** each individual in the population **has a set value of z.**

For target scenarios if the indiviudal's value is already at the target value or beyond the target value then their value is not changed. E.g. If the target value for physical activity is 2.5 METs/week, then any individual that already has METs/week >= 2.5 METs/week then there value will not be adjusted.

The changes for each type of scenario for **alcohol, physical activity,** and **diet** are described in the following table:
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
(scenarios <- data.frame(
    Health.Behaviour = c(" ", "Alcohol Consumption", "Physical Activity", rep("Diet",4)),
    Absolute.change = c("Each individual ...", "Decreases the number of drinks they have per week by x", "Increases their own physical activity levels by x METs per week", "Increases the number of fruits they eat by x per week", "Increases the number of vegetables they eat by x per week", "Decreases the glasses of juice they drink by x per week", "Decreases the number of potatoes the eat by x per week"),
    Relative.change =c("Each individual ...", "Decreases the number of drinks they have per week by y %", "Increases their own physical activity levels by y % METs per week", "Increases the number of fruits they consume by y % per week", "Increases the number of vegetables they consume by y % per week", "Decreases the their glasses of juice by y % per week", "Decreases the number of potatoes they consume by y % per week"), 
    Target = c("Each individual has the value ...", "z drinks per week", "z METs per week", "z fruits per week", "z vegetables per week", "z glasses of juice per week", "z potatoes per week")
    ))#closingbracket 

```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Creating the table
kable(scenarios) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = T) %>%
  collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top") 
```


The **smoking** health intervention scenario is different then the other types of health intervention scenarios as they adjust the prevalence of the health behaviour. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
(scenarios.smoke <- data.frame(
    Health.Behaviour = c("Smoking"),
    Absolute.change = c("The prevalence of smokers decreases by x %"),
    Relative.change =c("The prevalence of smokers decreases by y %"), 
    Target = c("The prevalence of smokers is z %")
    ))#closingbracket 

```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Creating the table
kable(scenarios.smoke) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = T)
```

Although each type of health intervention for smoking: absolute, relative and target, changes the prevalence of current smokers they are different. The following figure shows how each is different from one another. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap= "Comparison of health intervention scenario types"}
knitr::include_graphics("Scenario-Abs, Rel, Target cropped.jpg")
```

To adjust the prevalence of smokers, the change is applied to every current smoker in the population; individuals are not selected at random. ....



##Scenario: Cause-deleted

What would be the life expectancy of a population if be no one in the population ever smoked? This scenario is a cause-deleted scenario.

There are two distinct terms in cause-deleted calculations:

- **Cause-deleted life expectancy** is the estimated life expectancy for the counterfactual population where a specific cause (e.g. smoking) never existed. E.g. the counterfactual population was always never smokers.

- **Cause-deleted effect of life expectancy** or **life years lost due to the cause** is the full effect of the cause (e.g smoking) in the population. E.g. In a population 3 years of life are lost due to individuals in that population smoking: either currently or previously.

If multiple causes are selected (e.g. smoking and physical inactivity) the cause-deleted life expectancy calculated accounts for both of these effects and the cause-deleted effect of life expectancy (or life years lost) is calculated for each individual cause.

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** $\text{Cause-deleted life expectancy of smoking and physical inactivity} \neq$
$\text{Cause-deleted effect of smoking} + \text{Cause-deleted effect of physical inactivity}$

This is because individuals in the population may be both smokers and physically inactive.

There are two parts to the calculations preformed in cause-deleted scenarios: (A) calculate the risk, and (B) calculate the health outcome: life expectancy or number of deaths.

**Part A: Risk calculations**

The original multivariable predictive risk algorithm is: 

$$ \text{Risk} = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$


**Step 1.** Modify the original algorithm to include the external coefficient(s). This means replacing all predictive hazard ratios/betas related to the health behaviour to the causal hazard ratios/betas. 

- Remove the original regression coefficient(s) for the health behaviour.
- Add the new external coefficient(s) to the algorithm. External coefficients are generated from either: causal models, or from systematic reviews or meta-analysis.

$$ \text{External coefficient risk} = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{{\beta_\textbf{causal.smoking}}*x_{smoking} + {{\beta_\textbf{causal.cancer}}}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$
    

**Step 2.**	Risk is calculated using the modified algorithm created in Step 1 and the respondent’s original profile (e.g. current smoker). This is the “external coefficient risk”. 

$$ \text{External coefficient risk} = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\beta_{causal.smoking}* {(\textbf{current smoker})} + \beta_{causal.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$


**Step 3.**	“Cause-deleted risk' " is calculated by setting an exposure to a reference (non-exposed) value (all other risk exposures remain unchanged).

$$ \text{Cause-deleted risk' } = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\beta_{causal.smoking}* {(\textbf{never smoker})} + \beta_{causal.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$


**Step 4.**	The “cause-deleted effect external” is calculated as “external coefficient risk” (Step 2) minus the “cause-deleted risk’. ”(Step 3).

$$\text{Cause-deleted effect}_{external} = \text{External coefficient risk} - \text{Cause-deleted risk'}$$


**Step 5.**	Original risk is calculated using the original algorithm and the original respondent’s profile.

$$ \text{Original risk} = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{{\beta_\textbf{pred.smoking}}*{(\textbf{current smoker})}+{\beta_\textbf{pred.cancer}}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$


**Step 6.**	The “cause-deleted risk external” is calculated by “original risk” (Step 5) minus the “cause-deleted effect external” (Step 4).

$$\text{Cause-deleted risk}_{ external} = \text{Original risk} - \text{Cause-deleted effect}_{external}$$

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap= "Risk portion of the cause-deleted calculations"}
knitr::include_graphics("Method2 only -cbf.jpg")
```


**Part B: Health outcome calculations**

Using risks generated above you can then calculate:

- cause-deleted life expectancy or life years lost attributable to a health behaviour (exposure)
- cause-deleted number of deaths or number of deaths attributable to a health behaviour (exposure)


**Life expectancy calculations**

Step I: Calculate the original life expectancy by using the original risk (Step 5 above) in the sex-specific 5-year abridge period life tables.

Step II: Calculate the cause-deleted life expectancy by using the cause-deleted risk external (Step 6 above) in the sex-specific 5-year abridge period life tables.

Step III: Calculate life years attributable to a health behaviour by: original life expectancy (Step I) minus cause-deleted life expectancy (Step II):

$$ \text{Life years due to exposure} = \text{Original life expectancy} - \text{Cause-deleted life expectancy}$$
If the life years attributable to a health behaviour are negative then the value represents the life years lost due to smoking. 

**Number of deaths calculations**

Step I: Calculate the number of deaths that would occur using the original risk (Step 5 above).

Step II: Calculate the number of deaths that would occur using the cause-deleted risk external (Step 6 above).

Step III: Calculate the number of deaths that are attributable to a health behaviour (exposure) by: original number of deaths (Step I) minus cause-deleted number of deaths (Step II):

$$\text{Deaths due to exposure} = \text{Original number of deaths} - \text{Cause-deleted number of deaths}$$
