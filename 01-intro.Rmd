#Introduction

The Project Big Life Planning Tool was developed in order to support public health practitioners: research, plan, and develop evidence-based policy.

**How does it work?**

- This tool provides public health practitioners with access to population predictive risk algorithms, created and housed by the Project Big Life Team.

- The population predictive risk algorithms use distinct characteristics and health profiles of groups of people to assess the risk of a health outcome (e.g. Life Expectancy).

- The population predictive risk algorithms are developed and validated using routinely collected data by Statistics Canada and provincial health agencies, and the algorithms have been published in various journals.

- More information about population predictive risk algorithms can be found in the reference section (Chapter \@ref(keytopics)).

**Why should I used it?**

- It is **easy** and **flexible** to use. 

    - The user only needs to upload their data and choose which calculation to run.
    - It can be used to assess the current or future risk of a health outcome
    - It can be used to assess the effectiveness of different intervention scenarios (e.g. policy) on a health outcome.
    
    
-	It generates **accurate** predictions.

    - It can be used to accurately assess the risk of a health outcome in populations that were not used in its developement, and groups of people that account for only a fraction of the population. 

    
-	It is **Private**. 

    - Uploaded data remains on your computer and is not uploaded or sent anywhere.
