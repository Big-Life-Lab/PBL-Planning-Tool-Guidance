###What is the Project Big Life Planning Tool

The Project Big Life Planning Tool supports public health professionals research, plan, develop, and evaluate evidence-based health interventions in just a few steps. 

The tool can help you:

- Determine who in the population is at risk
- Predict number of new cases of the disease for a population
- Determine how much a risk factor contributes to a health outcome
- Assess health benefits of potential interventions

The tool is accessible to everyone and easy to use.


###Who made the Project Big Life Planning Tool?

The Project Big Life Planning Tool was developed by the [Project Big Life](https://www.projectbiglife.ca) Team based at the [Ottawa Hospital](http://www.ohri.ca/home.asp) and the [Bruy√®re Research Institute](https://www.bruyere.org/en/bruyere-research-institute).

The planning tool was made in collaboration with [Public Health Ontario](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/), the [Population Health Analytics Lab](https://pophealthanalytics.com/) at the University of Toronto and [Ottawa Public Health](http://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/index.aspx). 

The tool supports the [Seven More Years](https://www.ices.on.ca/Publications/Atlases-and-Reports/2012/Seven-More-Years) report, a study that examined the health behaviour attributale mortality in Ontario. Algorithms used in the planning tool were developed using linked population data housed at [ICES](https://www.ices.on.ca/) and validated at Statistics Canada. All algorithms have been published in peer-review journals. See [Project Big Life](https://www.projectbiglife.ca/science) or [appendices](#mport) to the specific algorithms.
