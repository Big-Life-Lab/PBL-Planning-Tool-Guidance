###Who made the Project Big Life Planning Tool?

The Project Big Life Planning Tool was developed by the [Project Big Life](https://www.projectbiglife.ca) Team based at the [Ottawa Hospital](http://www.ohri.ca/home.asp) and the [Bruy√®re Research Institute](https://www.bruyere.org/en/bruyere-research-institute). The planning tool was made in collaboration with [Public Health Ontario](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/), the [Population Helath Analytics Lab](https://pophealthanalytics.com/) at the University of Toronto and [Ottawa Public Health](http://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/index.aspx). The tool supports the [Seven More Years](https://www.ices.on.ca/Publications/Atlases-and-Reports/2012/Seven-More-Years) report, a study that examined the health behaviour attributale mortality in Ontario. Algorithms used in the planning tool were developed using linked population data housed at [ICES](https://www.ices.on.ca/) and validated at Statistics Canada. All algorithms have been published in peer-review journals. See [Project Big Life](https://www.projectbiglife.ca/science) or [references](#mport) to the specific algorithms.
