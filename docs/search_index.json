["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction The Project Big Life Planning Tool was developed in order to support health professionals: research, plan, develop, and evaluate evidence-based health interventions. For instance Project Big Life Planning Tool helps: Public health professionals: assess the impact of a preventative intervention on a health behaviour Health planners: assess the need for palliative care What types of questions can it answer? The Project Big Life Planning Tool can answer the following types of questions: What is the burden of smoking on life expectancy? How many deaths would be prevented if everyone met their daily exercise requirements? How does it work? This tool provides health planners with access to multivariable predictive risk algorithms, created and housed by the Project Big Life Team. The multivariable predictive risk algorithms use distinct characteristics and health profiles of groups of people to assess the risk of a health outcome (e.g. Life Expectancy). The multivariable predictive risk algorithms are developed and validated using data routinely collected by Statistics Canada and provincial health agencies, and the algorithms have been published in various journals. More information about multivariable predictive risk algorithms can be found in the key concepts (Chapter 6). Why should I used it? It is easy and flexible to use. The user only needs to upload their data and choose which calculation to run. It can be used to assess the future risk of a health outcome. It can be used to assess the effectiveness of different intervention scenarios (e.g. policy) on a health outcome. It generates accurate predictions. It can be used to accurately assess the risk of a health outcome in populations that were not used in its developement, and groups of people that account for only a fraction of the population. It is Private. Uploaded data remains on your computer and is not uploaded or sent anywhere. "],

Multivariable predictive risk algorithms can be used to: Project the number of new cases of the health outcome Estimate the contribution of specific risk factors of the health outcome Evaluate effectiveness of health interventions Describe the distribution of risk in the population (diffused or concentrated) Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are able to assess equity issues compared to competing population risk methods (e.g. World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease). More information on what multivariable predictive risk algorithms are and how they can be used can be found the journal article: Predictive risk algorithms in a population setting: an overview (Manuel D 2012) 6.2.1 Development of multivariable predictive risk algorithms **Data:** Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are created using routinely collected data that includes information about risk factors (exposure) and health events (outcomes). Data is collected at an individual level through population health surveys (e.g. Canadian Community Health Survey) and administrative databases (e.g. Vital Statistics). Data sources are linked together when the individual has given permission too. Individuals are followed overtime until the health event (e.g. death or disease) occurs. Separate data is collected to create a derivation cohort and validation cohort(s). Note: The risk factors that are collected are from population health surveys and are self-reported; no clinical data (e.g. blood pressure) is collected. Risk factors focus on health behaviours (e.g. smoking) and sociodemographic factors, commonly associated with health outcome. Algorithm generation: Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are cox porportional hazard models that analyze time to health outcome (e.g. death) Question for Carol - The models are not cox-porportional hazard models but they are similar? Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are developed and validated in 4 stages: Algorithm derivation: the predictive risk algorithm is created using data from the derivation cohort Algorithm validation: the predictive risk algorithm is applied to the validation cohort Final algorithm generation: validation and derivation cohorts are combined to estimate the final application of the predictive risk algorithm Derivation of the application algorithm: creation of a parsimonous (fewer predictors) algorithm that maintained discrimination, calibration, and overall algorithm performance In each stage of the algorithm development and validation, algorithm performance is assessed using measures of discrimination and calibration. 6.2.2 Multivariable predictive risk algorithms built in Project Big Life Planning Tool There is currently 1 multivariable predictive risk algorithm is built into to Project Big Life planning tool.

["calculations.html", "6.3 Calculations", " 6.3 Calculations 6.3.1 Risk of health outcome Risk of the health outcome (e.g. risk of dying) is the outcome of the multivariable predictive risk algorithm. An example of the mutlivariable risk algorithm is: \\[ \\text{Risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.male}*x_{male} +...} \\] Where: \\(t\\) = survival time \\(h_0(t)\\) = the baseline hazard \\(\\beta_{pred}\\) = predictive hazard ratios for the exposures \\(x\\) = the exposure (e.g. \\(x_{smoking}\\) can have the value: current smoker, former smoker &lt;=5 years, former smoker &gt; 5 years, or never smoker). 6.3.2 Number of health outcomes The number of health outcomes (e.g. Summary Deaths) is calculated through the following steps: Risk of the health outcome is calculated for each individual in the dataset using the mutlivariable predictive risk algorithm. The weighted mean of all the risks is calculated using individual risk values and corresponding study weights (CCHS variable: WTS_M). The weighted mean is then multiplied with the total number of individuals in the population to generate the number of health outcomes (e.g. number of deaths in 5 years). 6.3.3 Life expectancy calculation Life expectancy is calculated using abridge life tables: The mortality risk for each individual is calculated using the mutlivariable predictive risk algorithm for mortality (MPoRT ??). Mortality risks for each individual are weighted using the corresponding survey weights (CCHS variable - WTS_M). Weighted mortality risks are then used in sex-specific 5-year abridge period life tables. Life expectancy was then calculated using these 5-year abridge period life tables. 6.3.4 Cause-deletion calculations What would be the life expectancy of a population if be no one in the population ever smoked? This scenario is a cause-deleted scenario. To Do: Insert video of cause deleted calculations that explains Method 1 vs. Method 2 There are two parts to the cause-deleted calculations: (A) calculate the risk, and (B) calculate the health outcome: life expectancy or number of deaths. Part A: Risk calculations The original multivariable predictive risk algorithm is: \\[ \\text{Risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.male}*x_{male} +...} \\] Step 1. Modify the original algorithm to include the external coefficient(s). This means replacing all predictive hazard ratios/betas related to the health behaviour to the causal hazard ratios/betas. Remove the original regression coefficient(s) for the health behaviour. Add the new external coefficient(s) to the algorithm. External coefficients are generated from either: causal models, or from systematic reviews or meta-analysis. \\[ \\text{External coefficient risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{{\\beta_\\textbf{causal.smoking}}*x_{smoking} + {{\\beta_\\textbf{causal.cancer}}}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.male}*x_{male} +...} \\] Step 2. Risk is calculated using the modified algorithm created in Step 1 and the respondent’s original profile (e.g. current smoker). This is the “external coefficient risk”. \\[ \\text{External coefficient risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{causal.smoking}* {(\\textbf{current smoker})} + \\beta_{causal.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.male}*x_{male} +...} \\] Step 3. “Cause-deleted risk’” is calculated by setting an exposure to a reference (non-exposed) value (all other risk exposures remain unchanged). \\[ \\text{Cause-deleted risk&#39; } = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{causal.smoking}* {(\\textbf{never smoker})} + \\beta_{causal.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.male}*x_{male} +...} \\] Step 4. The “cause-deleted effect external” is calculated as “external coefficient risk” (Step 2) minus the “cause-deleted risk’.”(Step 3). \\[\\text{Cause-deleted effect}_{external} = \\text{External coefficient risk} - \\text{Cause-deleted risk&#39;}\\] Step 5. Original risk is calculated using the original algorithm and the original respondent’s profile. \\[ \\text{Original risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{{\\beta_\\textbf{pred.smoking}}*{(\\textbf{current smoker})}+{\\beta_\\textbf{pred.cancer}}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.male}*x_{male} +...} \\] Step 6. The “cause-deleted risk external” is calculated by “original risk” (Step 5) minus the “cause-deleted effect external” (Step 4). \\[\\text{Cause-deleted risk}_{ external} = \\text{Original risk} - \\text{Cause-deleted effect}_{external}\\] Figure 6.1: Risk porportion of cause-deleted calculations Part B: Health outcome calculations Using risks generated above you can then calculate: cause-deleted life expectancy or life years lost attributable to a health behaviour (exposure) cause-deleted number of deaths or number of deaths attributable to a health behaviour (exposure) Life expectancy calculations Step I: Calculate the original life expectancy by using the original risk (Step 5 above) in the sex-specific 5-year abridge period life tables. Step II: Calculate the cause-deleted life expectancy by using the cause-deleted risk external (Step 6 above) in the sex-specific 5-year abridge period life tables. Step III: Calculate life years lost attributable to a health behaviour by: original life expectancy (Step I) minus cause-deleted life expectancy (Step II): \\[ \\text{Life years lost} = \\text{Original life expectancy} - \\text{Cause-deleted life expectancy}\\] Number of deaths calculations Step I: Calculate the number of deaths that would occur using the original risk (Step 5 above). Step II: Calculate the number of deaths that would occur using the cause-deleted risk external (Step 6 above). Step III: Calculate the number of deaths that are attributable to a health behaviour (exposure) by: original number of deaths (Step I) minus cause-deleted number of deaths (Step II): \\[\\text{Deaths due to exposure} = \\text{Original number of deaths} - \\text{Cause-deleted number of deaths}\\] "],

BMI is calculated by dividing an individual’s body weight in kilograms by the square of height in metres (kg/m2). Burden The impact or size of a health problem in an area, measured by cost, mortality, morbidity or other indicators. The burden of unhealthy behaviour is calculated by the differences in life expectancy based on individuals’ exposure to four health behavioural risks for poor health relative to the healthy category.

Cause-deleted life expectancy A cause-deleted health outcome is the estimated health outcome of a population if a specific cause (e.g. smoking) did not exist in that population. Discrimination The ability of the model to differentiate between high risk individuals and low risk individuals. Error Message Error messages will occur when variables that are “Required for Calculation” are missing in the data. If the entire column for the variable is missing then the calculation cannot be performed on the data. If there are missing row entries for the variable then the entire row will not be used in the calculation. Exposure In the risk algorithms the exposure refers to the level of the predictor varaible, e.g. for the predictor variable EDUDR04 there are four levels of exposure: (1) Post-Secondary, (2) Some Post-Secondary, (3) High School, (4) Less then High School. Filter Chooses part of your dataset for analysis. If you filter on ‘Sex’ and then ‘Male’, calculations will only be performed on individuals that are ‘Male’ and ‘Females’ will be excluded. For example, when calculating Life Expectancy on the filter variable ‘Sex’ then ‘Male’ there will be a Life Expectancy estimate for ‘Males’ and no Life Expectancy estimate for ‘Females’. Health Behaviour Actions people do that may affect their health, positively or negatively. Health behaviours are among the determinants of health and are influenced by the social, cultural and physical environments in which people live and work.(Statistics Canada 2010) They are also shaped by individual choices and external constraints.(Statistics Canada 2010) The four health behaviours of smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical activity are specified in Project Big Life’s planning tool. Ignored Variables Are not included in the calculation. It does not matter if your dataset includes these variables or not. Ignored variables can used for filter and stratification. Life Expectancy (LE) Life expectancy is a calculation of how long a person or population would be expected to live, on average, given unchanging risk of death from a specific point in time. Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) The metabolic equivalent of task (MET) is a measure of the rate of energy expenditure from an activity; a measure of calories burned by type, duration and frequency of physical activity. The reference value of 1 MET is defined as the energy expediture rate at rest which is equal to 1kcal/kg/day. Predictor A variable that is used in the algorithm to predict the outcome. Recommend for calculation Variables that are included in the calculation but not necessary for the calculation to run. Rather these variables increase the accuracy of the results. Required for calculation Variables that are included in the calculations and are necessary for the calculation to run. If a dataset does not have these variables then the calculation will not run. Risk The probability ofa health event occuring at some point of time in the future. Socioeconomic Position People in poorer socioeconomic circumstances generally have poorer health. Deprivation measures identify those who experience material or social disadvantage compared to others in their community. The Deprivation Index for Health in Canada developed by the Institut national desanté publique du Québec (INSPQ)(Pampalon R, Raymond G 2000) is used in this plannning tool. The index includes education, employment and income as measures of material deprivation; and single-parent families, living alone, or being divorced, widowed or separated as measures of social deprivation. The deprivation index was used to assign geographical areas into socioeconomic position groups (low, middle and high) based on material and social quintiles. High-deprivation neighbourhoods were those in the top two quintiles for both social and material deprivation. Low-deprivation neighbourhoods were those in the bottom two quintiles. Stratification The seperation of data into smaller strata (levels or classes which individuals are assigned too). If the variable ‘Sex’ is stratified it creates two strata: ‘Male’ and ‘Female’. Calculations are performed on each strata (level or class) and the outcome will be specific to that strata. For example, when calculating Life Expectancy on the stratified variable ‘Sex’ there will be a Life Expectancy estimate for ‘Males’ and a different Life Expectancy estimate for ‘Females’. Summary Measures When selected, the output .csv file will include the calculation result for the entire population of the dataset. Warning Message Warning messages will occur when variables that are “Recommended for Calculation” are missing in the data. If the entire column for the variable is missing the calculation will still be performed on the data. If there are missing row entries for the variable the row will still be used in the calculation.

How many deaths would be prevented if everyone met their daily excercise requirements? Description: A multivariable predictive risk model that estimates the future risk of all-cause death in Canada. It adjusts for health behaviours: smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, poor diet, and physical inactivity, and a wide range of other risk factors. Versions of MPoRT have been developed since 2012 and used in various studies. Each version of MPoRT (v1.0, v1.2, v2.0) used the Ontario subset of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) for development and the survey respondents were linked to personal death records. In later versions of MPoRT (v1.2, v2.0) the following changes were made:, (a) algorithm variables were adjusted to improve predictions, and (b) the algorithms were validated using: the Ontario subset of CCHS of the years that were not used in development and the National CCHS dataset (excluding Ontario). MPoRTv1.0 Was used in the “Seven More Years” report, a joint report with Public Health Ontario and IC/ES (https://www.ices.on.ca/Publications/Atlases-and-Reports/2012/Seven-More-Years). In summary, the algorithm estimated the risk of death associated with health behaviours: smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, poor diet, physical inactivity and stress. There were approximately 550,000 person-years of follow up and over 6000 deaths in the development dataset. The algorthim used categorical predictor variables for health behaviours and sociodemographic factors. MPoRTv1.2 Was published in PLoS (https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002082). In summary, the algorithm estimated the risk of death associated with health behaviours: smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, poor diet, and physical inactivity (stress was removed due to its low prediction ability). There were approximately 1 million person-years of follow up and over 9000 deaths in the development and validation datasets. The algorithm used multiple continous predictor variables, and added chronic disease predictor variables and interaction terms. MPoRTv2.0 - The version used in Project Big Life’s Planning Tool This version of MPoRT has not yet been published. Development: This predictive risk model was developed using Ontario subsets of the 2001 to 2008 CCHS and participants were linked to personal health records. There were approximately 1.3 million person-years of follow-up and over 15,000 deaths in the developmental dataset. Validation: This predictive risk model was validated using three different datasets: Ontario subset of the 2009 to 2012 CCHS, National dataset (except Ontario) of the 2003 to 2008 CCHS, and the National dataset of the 2000 and 2005 National Health Interview Survey in the United States of America. In all validation datasets individuals were linked to personal health records.
