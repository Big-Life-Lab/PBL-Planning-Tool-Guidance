["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction The Project Big Life Planning Tool was developed in order to support health professionals: research, plan, develop, and evaluate evidence-based health interventions. For instance Project Big Life Planning Tool helps: Public health professionals: assess the impact of preventative interventions that target health behaviours Health planners: assess the need for palliative care What types of questions can it answer? The Project Big Life Planning Tool can answer the following types of questions: What is the burden of smoking on life expectancy? How many deaths would be prevented if everyone met their daily exercise requirements? How does it work? This tool provides health planners with access to multivariable predictive risk algorithms, created and housed by the Project Big Life Team. The multivariable predictive risk algorithms use distinct characteristics and health profiles of groups of people to assess the risk of a health outcome (e.g. Life Expectancy). The multivariable predictive risk algorithms are developed and validated using data routinely collected by Statistics Canada and provincial health agencies, and the algorithms have been published in various journals. More information about multivariable predictive risk algorithms can be found in the key concepts (Chapter 6). Why should I used it? It is easy and flexible to use. The user only needs to upload their data and choose which calculation to run. It can be used to assess the future risk of a health outcome. It can be used to assess the effectiveness of different intervention scenarios (e.g. policy) on a health outcome. It generates accurate predictions. It can be used to accurately assess the risk of a health outcome in populations that were not used in its developement, and groups of people that account for only a fraction of the population. It is private. Loaded data remains on your computer and is not uploaded or sent anywhere. "],

For example you can answer the questions: what if we only had 15% of the population smoked rather then the current 20%? what if everyone increased their physical activity by 10%? what if everyone ate 4 fruit servings each day? what if everyone drank 2 fewer drinks per week? These intervention scenarios allow you to predict and compare the effectiveness of policies. There are 3 types of intervention scenarios that you can select: Absolute: each individual in the population changes their health behaviour by a value of x. Relative: each individual in the population changes their health behaviour by a ratio of y. Target: each individual in the population has a set value of z.

["canada-bikes-like-the-dutch.html", "5.2 Canada bikes like the Dutch", " 5.2 Canada bikes like the Dutch Cycling as a form of transportation, is an effective way of increasing individuals’ daily physical activity levels which leads to a decrease in the risk of disease and death. In this example we will determine the impact on life expectancy if Canadians were to cycle like the Dutch, who are world-renowned for their cycling. In this example we determine: A. How much Canadians cycle per day for transportation purposes, B. How much Dutch cycle per day for transportation purposes, C. The difference in daily cycling levels for transportation of Canadians and Dutch, and D. Predict how Canadian life expectancy would change if Canadians biked like the Dutch. For this example we will use the sample data set data.sample, which can be downloaded at https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/PBL-Planning-Tool---Applications-Vignettes. This link also contains all of the R code for this vignette. The following steps include the R coding for each of the steps but you can preform the steps in any other software program. 5.2.1 Part A: How much do Canadians cycle per day for transportation purposes We will determine how much Canadians cycle per day by calculating the average daily energy expenditure from cycling in the current Canadian population. We will use 3 variables in our sample data set which are based off of the 2013/2014 CCHS PUMF and measure cycling as a form of active transportation: PAC_8: In the past 3 months did you cycle to and from work or school? PAC_8A: How many times did you cycle to and from work or school, in the past 3 months? PAC_8B: How much time did you spend on each occasion? Step 1: Import your data set to R. PA.data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data.sample&quot;) Assumption #1: we assume individuals 65 or older are retired and therefore not cycling to/from work/school. Therefore, we will only evaluate individuals that are &lt; 65 years old. Step 2: Filter the data: &lt; 65. The CCHS data set has categories for age, therefore we will filter out all age categories that are &gt;=65 years old. library(dplyr) PA.data &lt;- PA.data %&gt;% filter(DHHGAGE &lt;= 12) We will first evaluate the data for individuals that cycle to/from work/school (PAC_8, answer 1) only: Step 3: Find the average number of times, that an individual cycled to/from work/school in the past 3 months Exclude the missing data - all individuals that did not cycle in the past 3 months: do not cycle to/from work school, do not know, refused to answer, or did not answer PA.data$PAC_8A[PA.data$PAC_8A == 996] &lt;- NA PA.data$PAC_8A[PA.data$PAC_8A == 997] &lt;- NA PA.data$PAC_8A[PA.data$PAC_8A == 998] &lt;- NA PA.data$PAC_8A[PA.data$PAC_8A == 999] &lt;- NA Calculate the average number of times that an individual cycled to/from work/school (mean of PAC_8A) freq.cycle &lt;- mean(PA.data$PAC_8A, na.rm = TRUE) Step 4: Find the average time spent cycling to/from work/school, in the past 3 months Exclude the missing data - all individuals that did not cycle in the past 3 months: do not cycle to/from work school, do not know, refused to answer, or did not answer PA.data$PAC_8B[PA.data$PAC_8B == 6] &lt;- NA PA.data$PAC_8B[PA.data$PAC_8B == 7] &lt;- NA PA.data$PAC_8B[PA.data$PAC_8B == 8] &lt;- NA PA.data$PAC_8B[PA.data$PAC_8B == 9] &lt;- NA Calculate the mean time spent cycling (mean of PAC_8B). Note: Since the PAC_8B variable has 15 minute time periods (1 = 1 to 15 minutes, 2 = 16 to 30 minutes), we will convert the mean into minutes by multiplying the mean of PAC_8A with 15. time.cycle &lt;- 15 * mean(PA.data$PAC_8B, na.rm = TRUE) There are other ways you can do this step. You can take the average of the medians for each time period or use both the minimum and maximum for each time period. Convert the mean time spent cycling to/from work/school from minutes to hours. time.hour.cycle &lt;- time.cycle/60 Step 5: Calculate the average duration of cycling. Duration is calculated with the following formula: \\(\\text{Duration} = [\\text{(Frequency/3 months)}*\\text{(Time/trip)}] / \\text{(Days/3 months)}\\) duration.cycle &lt;- (time.hour.cycle*freq.cycle)/(30.42*3) Step 6: Calculate the average daily energy expenditure (MET-hours) for cycling to/from work/school \\(\\text{MET-hours} = \\text{Duration}*\\text{MET value for walking}\\) Note: For Canadians to cycle like the Dutch, we need to use the Dutch MET cycling value of 5.8 and not the Canadian MET cycling value of 4.0. The Dutch MET value accounts for the speed of cycling of the Dutch. MET.hours.cycle &lt;- (duration.cycle*5.8) We now have our average daily energy expenditure (MET-hours) for Canadians that DO cycle to/from work/school. Now we need to account for the rest of the population that does not cycle to/from work school.

The average Dutch daily energy expenditure from cycling as a form of transportation for both sexes is then 1.35 MET-hours. 5.2.3 Part C: Calculate the difference between Dutch and Canadian daily cycling levels Canadians need to increase their daily energy expenditure from cycling from 0.07 MET-hours to 1.35 MET-hours, in order to be like the Dutch. Abs.change &lt;- 1.35 - MET.hours.cycle.all 5.2.4 Part D: Predict how Canadian life expectancy would change if Canadians biked like the Dutch.

Each year the CCHS changes a few variables it captures. This makes CCHS data sets from every year other then 2013/2014 incompatible with the algorithms used by the Project Big Life Planning Tool. The Project Big Life Planning Team is currently working to adjust the algorithms so that they accept other CCHS years, and we will update the guidance when we are done. 6.1.3 Sample Files data.sample.csv this is fabricated data set that includes all variables required for calculation, recommend for calculation, and needed for the real life application examples (found in Chapter 5). It includes all required and recommended variables: age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, diet components, daily physical activity expenditure, chronic conditions, ethnicity, immigration status, and education. Note: Although the data.sample.csv is based on the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey Public Use Microdata File from if was created only for example purposes and cannot be used for analysis.

Multivariable predictive risk algorithms can be used to: Project the number of new cases of the health outcome Estimate the contribution of specific risk factors of the health outcome Evaluate effectiveness of health interventions Describe the distribution of risk in the population (diffused or concentrated) Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are able to assess equity issues compared to competing population risk methods (e.g. World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease). More information on what multivariable predictive risk algorithms are and how they can be used can be found the journal article: Predictive risk algorithms in a population setting: an overview (Manuel D 2012) 6.2.1 Development of multivariable predictive risk algorithms Data: Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are created using routinely collected data that includes information about risk factors (exposure) and health events (outcomes). Data is collected at an individual level through population health surveys (e.g. Canadian Community Health Survey) and administrative databases (e.g. Vital Statistics). Data sources are linked together when the individual has given permission too. Individuals are followed overtime until the health event (e.g. death or disease) occurs. Separate data is collected to create a derivation cohort and validation cohort(s). Note: The risk factors that are collected are from population health surveys and are self-reported; no clinical data (e.g. blood pressure) is collected. Risk factors focus on health behaviours (e.g. smoking) and sociodemographic factors, commonly associated with health outcome. Algorithm generation: Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are cox proportional hazard models that analyze time to health outcome (e.g. death) Question for Carol - The models are not cox-porportional hazard models but they are similar? Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are developed and validated in 4 stages: Algorithm derivation: the predictive risk algorithm is created using data from the derivation cohort Algorithm validation: the predictive risk algorithm is applied to the validation cohort Final algorithm generation: validation and derivation cohorts are combined to estimate the final application of the predictive risk algorithm Derivation of the application algorithm: creation of a parsimonous (fewer predictors) algorithm that maintained discrimination, calibration, and overall algorithm performance In each stage of the algorithm development and validation, algorithm performance is assessed using measures of discrimination and calibration. 6.2.2 Multivariable predictive risk algorithms built in Project Big Life Planning Tool There is currently 1 multivariable predictive risk algorithm is built into to Project Big Life planning tool.

["calculations-specific-health-outcomes.html", "6.4 Calculations: specific health outcomes", " 6.4 Calculations: specific health outcomes 6.4.1 Risk of health outcome Risk of the health outcome (e.g. risk of dying) is the outcome of a multivariable predictive risk algorithm. An example of the mutlivariable risk algorithm is: \\[ \\text{Risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Where: \\(t\\) = survival time \\(h_0(t)\\) = the baseline hazard \\(\\beta_{pred}\\) = predictive hazard ratios for the exposures \\(x\\) = the exposure. The exposure can be continuous (e.g. age) or categorical (e.g. smoking status). Categorical exposures are represented by dummy/factor variables. Each category has its own beta and the exposure is binary. For example smoking status is categorical variable with categories: current, former &lt;= 5 years, former &gt;5 years, or never smoked. For \\(\\beta_{pred.current.smoker}\\) the exposure: \\(x_{current.smoker}\\) = 1 if the individual currently smokes or 0 if the individual is another type of smoker. 6.4.2 Number of health outcomes The number of health outcomes (e.g. summary - deaths) is calculated through the following steps: Risk of the health outcome is calculated for each individual (row) in the data set using the mutlivariable predictive risk algorithm. Each individual’s (row) risk is weighted with their corresponding survey weight (CCHS PUMF = WTS_M and CCHS shared file = WTS_S). \\[ \\text{Weighted risk of death } = \\text{Individual&#39;s risk of death}*\\text{Individual&#39;s survey weight}\\] The weighted mean of the health outcome (e.g. mean risk of death) is calculated. The weighted mean is then multiplied with the total number of individuals in the population to generate the number of health outcomes (e.g. number of deaths in 5 years). 6.4.3 Life expectancy Life expectancy is calculated using abridge life tables using a modified Chaing approach.(link to reference for Chiang and Hsieh and also one of our papers). Life expectancy is calculated by two methods: one for summary life expectancy, and a second for by row life expectancy. 6.4.3.1 Summary Life Expectancy Life expectancy is calculated separately for males and females. Males: The mortality risk for each male individual is calculated using the male mortality mutlivariable predictive risk algorithm for mortality (MPoRT). Details about the MPoRT can be found in Appendix A. Male individuals are grouped into the 5-year age groups that are used in the 5-year abridge life tables (e.g. 40-44 years old). The weighted average risk of death for each age group is calculated. (Maybe modify this formula and put it in the number of health outcomes section?) \\[ \\text{Weighted risk of death for age group} = \\sum(\\text{Weighted risk of deaths}) \\div \\text{Number of individuals in age group}\\] A male 5-year abridge life table is created using the weighted average risks of death (q(x)) for each age group and the median age for the age group. Females Steps 1-4 used to calculate life expectancy for males, are repeated for females using the female MPoRT and a female 5-year abridge life table. Summary life expectancy The summary life expectancy, or life expectancy of the entire population, is calculated by adding the male life expectancy with the female life expectancy, and taking its average. Summary life expectancy by strata Steps (1-4) are repeated for each strata. There will be strata specific weighted risk of death and strata specific life tables. Step 5 is repeated with the average life expectancy calculated across all strata. 6.4.3.2 By row life expectancy An individual’s life expectancy is calculated by creating a new life table specific to that individual. These life tables are 1-year abridge life tables, and begin at the individual’s age (e.g. an individual that is 43 years old, will have the life table start at 43 years). The probability of death for a person’s current age is calculated using the respective MPoRT (male or female), and the individual’s health profile (e.g. never smoked, 15 drinks weekly, has hypertension, is a Canadian Citizen, etc) (e.g. \\(q_x\\), where \\(x=43\\)). The probability of death is recalculated for incremental older ages (additional rows of the life table) up to age 90 years ( \\(q_\\text{(x+1)}, q_\\text{(x+2)}...q_{90}\\)). For each life table row, age is the only variable that is changed for MPoRT risk calculation. Not sure what Doug is trying to get at here… Note: Life expectancy calculation is for the respondent’s age (eg. 43). To calculate age of death, add the respondent’s age to their life expectancy estimate. Note: By row life expectancy does not account for the individual’s weight, and therefore can not be used to estimate the summary life expectancy. "],
["scenario-intervention.html", "6.5 Scenario: Intervention", " 6.5 Scenario: Intervention How would life expectancy change if everyone increased their physical activity levels by 10%? The health intervention scenario allows you to predict how changing the health behaviours: alcohol consumption, diet, physical activity, and smoking, of a population will affect the population health outcome (e.g. life expectancy). This feature can be used to predict the effectiveness of proposed policies or programs. There are three types of scenarios: absolute, relative, and target. Absolute: each individual in the population changes their health behaviour by a value of x. Relative: each individual in the population changes their health behaviour by a ratio of y. Target: each individual in the population has a set value of z. For target scenarios if the individual’s value is already at the target value or beyond the target value then their value is not changed. E.g. If the target value for physical activity is 2.5 METs/day, then any individual that already has METs/day &gt;= 2.5 METs/week then there value will not be adjusted. The changes for each type of scenario for alcohol, physical activity, and diet are described in the following table: Health.Behaviour Absolute.change Relative.change Target Each individual changes … Each individual changes … Each individual has the value … Alcohol Consumption the number of drinks they have per week by x the number of drinks they have per week by y % z drinks per week Physical Activity their physical activity level by x METs per day their physical activity level by y % METs per day z METs per day Diet the number of servings of fruits and vegetables they eat by x per day the number servings of fruits and vegetables they eat by y % per day z fruits and vegetables per day the number of glasses of juice they drink by x per week the number of glasses of juice by y % per day z glasses of juice per day the number of servings of potatoes the eat by x per week the number of potatoes they eat by y % per day z potatoes per day The smoking health intervention scenario is different then the other types of health intervention scenarios as they adjust the prevalence of the health behaviour.

["scenario-cause-deleted.html", "6.6 Scenario: Cause-deleted", " 6.6 Scenario: Cause-deleted What would be the life expectancy of a population if be no one in the population ever smoked? This scenario is a cause-deleted scenario. There are two distinct terms in cause-deleted calculations: Cause-deleted life expectancy is the estimated life expectancy for the counterfactual population where a specific cause (e.g. smoking) never existed. E.g. the counterfactual population was always never smokers. Cause-deleted effect of life expectancy or life years lost due to the cause is the full effect of the cause (e.g smoking) in the population. E.g. In a population 3 years of life are lost due to individuals in that population smoking: either currently or previously. If multiple causes are selected (e.g. smoking and physical inactivity) the cause-deleted life expectancy calculated accounts for both of these effects and the cause-deleted effect of life expectancy (or life years lost) is calculated for each individual cause. Note: \\(\\text{Cause-deleted life expectancy of smoking and physical inactivity} \\neq\\) \\(\\text{Cause-deleted effect of smoking} + \\text{Cause-deleted effect of physical inactivity}\\) This is because individuals in the population may be both smokers and physically inactive. Insert table with the reference levels for each of the health behaviours 6.6.1 Cause-deleted calculation There are two parts to the calculations preformed in cause-deleted scenarios: (A) calculate the risk, and (B) calculate the health outcome: life expectancy or number of deaths. Part A: Risk calculations The original multivariable predictive risk algorithm is: \\[ \\text{Risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Step 1. Modify the original algorithm to include the external coefficient(s). This means replacing all predictive hazard ratios/betas related to the health behaviour to the causal hazard ratios/betas. Remove the original regression coefficient(s) for the health behaviour. Add the new external coefficient(s) to the algorithm. External coefficients are generated from either: causal models, or from systematic reviews or meta-analysis. \\[ \\text{External coefficient risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{{\\beta_\\textbf{causal.smoking}}*x_{smoking} + {{\\beta_\\textbf{causal.cancer}}}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Step 2. Risk is calculated using the modified algorithm created in Step 1 and the respondent’s original profile (e.g. current smoker). This is the “external coefficient risk”. \\[ \\text{External coefficient risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{causal.smoking}* {(\\textbf{current smoker})} + \\beta_{causal.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Step 3. “Cause-deleted risk’” is calculated by setting an exposure to a reference (non-exposed) value (all other risk exposures remain unchanged). \\[ \\text{Cause-deleted risk&#39; } = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{causal.smoking}* {(\\textbf{never smoker})} + \\beta_{causal.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Step 4. The “cause-deleted effect external” is calculated as “external coefficient risk” (Step 2) minus the “cause-deleted risk’.”(Step 3). \\[\\text{Cause-deleted effect}_{external} = \\text{External coefficient risk} - \\text{Cause-deleted risk&#39;}\\] Step 5. Original risk is calculated using the original algorithm and the original respondent’s profile. \\[ \\text{Original risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{{\\beta_\\textbf{pred.smoking}}*{(\\textbf{current smoker})}+{\\beta_\\textbf{pred.cancer}}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Step 6. The “cause-deleted risk external” is calculated by “original risk” (Step 5) minus the “cause-deleted effect external” (Step 4). \\[\\text{Cause-deleted risk}_{ external} = \\text{Original risk} - \\text{Cause-deleted effect}_{external}\\] Figure 6.2: Risk portion of the cause-deleted calculations Part B: Health outcome calculations Using risks generated above you can then calculate: cause-deleted life expectancy or life years lost attributable to a health behaviour (exposure) cause-deleted number of deaths or number of deaths attributable to a health behaviour (exposure) Life expectancy calculations Step I: Calculate the original life expectancy by using the original risk (Step 5 above) in the sex-specific 5-year abridge period life tables. Step II: Calculate the cause-deleted life expectancy by using the cause-deleted risk external (Step 6 above) in the sex-specific 5-year abridge period life tables. Step III: Calculate life years attributable to a health behaviour by: original life expectancy (Step I) minus cause-deleted life expectancy (Step II): \\[ \\text{Life years due to exposure} = \\text{Original life expectancy} - \\text{Cause-deleted life expectancy}\\] If the life years attributable to a health behaviour are negative then the value represents the life years lost due to smoking. Number of deaths calculations Step I: Calculate the number of deaths that would occur using the original risk (Step 5 above). Step II: Calculate the number of deaths that would occur using the cause-deleted risk external (Step 6 above). Step III: Calculate the number of deaths that are attributable to a health behaviour (exposure) by: original number of deaths (Step I) minus cause-deleted number of deaths (Step II): \\[\\text{Deaths due to exposure} = \\text{Original number of deaths} - \\text{Cause-deleted number of deaths}\\] "],

Discrimination The ability of the model to differentiate between high risk individuals and low risk individuals. Error Message Error messages will occur when variables that are “Required for Calculation” are missing in the data. If the entire column for the variable is missing then the calculation cannot be performed on the data. If there are missing row entries for the variable then the entire row will not be used in the calculation. Filter Chooses part of your dataset for analysis. If you filter on ‘Sex’ and then ‘Male’, calculations will only be performed on individuals that are ‘Male’ and ‘Females’ will be excluded. For example, when calculating Life Expectancy on the filter variable ‘Sex’ then ‘Male’ there will be a Life Expectancy estimate for ‘Males’ and no Life Expectancy estimate for ‘Females’. Health Behaviour Actions people do that may affect their health, positively or negatively. Health behaviours are among the determinants of health and are influenced by the social, cultural and physical environments in which people live and work.(Statistics Canada 2010) They are also shaped by individual choices and external constraints.(Statistics Canada 2010) The four health behaviours of smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical activity are specified in Project Big Life’s planning tool. Ignored Variables Are not included in the calculation. It does not matter if your dataset includes these variables or not. Ignored variables can used for filter and stratification.

Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) The metabolic equivalent of task (MET) is a measure of the rate of energy expenditure from an activity; a measure of calories burned by type, duration and frequency of physical activity. The reference value of 1 MET is defined as the energy expediture rate at rest which is equal to 1kcal/kg/day. Predictor A variable that is used in the algorithm to predict the outcome. Recommend for calculation Variables that are included in the calculation but not necessary for the calculation to run. Rather these variables increase the accuracy of the results. Required for calculation Variables that are included in the calculations and are necessary for the calculation to run. If a dataset does not have these variables then the calculation will not run. Risk The probability ofa health event occuring at some point of time in the future. Socioeconomic Position People in poorer socioeconomic circumstances generally have poorer health. Deprivation measures identify those who experience material or social disadvantage compared to others in their community. The Deprivation Index for Health in Canada developed by the Institut national desanté publique du Québec (INSPQ)(Pampalon R, Raymond G 2000) is used in this plannning tool. The index includes education, employment and income as measures of material deprivation; and single-parent families, living alone, or being divorced, widowed or separated as measures of social deprivation. The deprivation index was used to assign geographical areas into socioeconomic position groups (low, middle and high) based on material and social quintiles. High-deprivation neighbourhoods were those in the top two quintiles for both social and material deprivation. Low-deprivation neighbourhoods were those in the bottom two quintiles. Stratification The seperation of data into smaller strata (levels or classes which individuals are assigned too). If the variable ‘Sex’ is stratified it creates two strata: ‘Male’ and ‘Female’. Calculations are performed on each strata (level or class) and the outcome will be specific to that strata. For example, when calculating Life Expectancy on the stratified variable ‘Sex’ there will be a Life Expectancy estimate for ‘Males’ and a different Life Expectancy estimate for ‘Females’. Stratification can only occur on categorical variables. Summary Measures When selected, the result will be a single measure for the entire dataset. For instance when Summary Measure - Life Expectancy (Summary Measure) is selected the result is a single life expectancy at birth for the given for the population. When stratifications are selected, the summary measure will be given for each strata. For instance when Summary Measure - Life Expectancy and Stratification - Sex are selected, then two life expectancy measures will be given one for males and one for females.

How many deaths would be prevented if everyone met their daily excercise requirements? Description: A multivariable predictive risk model that estimates the future risk of all-cause death in Canada. It adjusts for health behaviours: smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, poor diet, and physical inactivity, and a wide range of other risk factors. Versions of MPoRT have been developed since 2012 and used in various studies. Each version of MPoRT (v1.0, v1.2, v2.0) used the Ontario subset of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) for development and the survey respondents were linked to personal death records. In later versions of MPoRT (v1.2, v2.0) the following changes were made:, (a) algorithm variables were adjusted to improve predictions, and (b) the algorithms were validated using: the Ontario subset of CCHS of the years that were not used in development and the National CCHS dataset (excluding Ontario). MPoRTv1.0 Was used in the “Seven More Years” report, a joint report with Public Health Ontario and IC/ES (https://www.ices.on.ca/Publications/Atlases-and-Reports/2012/Seven-More-Years). In summary, the algorithm estimated the risk of death associated with health behaviours: smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, poor diet, physical inactivity and stress. There were approximately 550,000 person-years of follow up and over 6000 deaths in the development dataset. The algorthim used categorical predictor variables for health behaviours and sociodemographic factors. MPoRTv1.2 Was published in PLoS (https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002082). In summary, the algorithm estimated the risk of death associated with health behaviours: smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, poor diet, and physical inactivity (stress was removed due to its low prediction ability). There were approximately 1 million person-years of follow up and over 9000 deaths in the development and validation datasets. The algorithm used multiple continous predictor variables, and added chronic disease predictor variables and interaction terms. MPoRTv2.0 - The version used in Project Big Life’s Planning Tool This version of MPoRT has not yet been published. Development: This predictive risk model was developed using Ontario subsets of the 2001 to 2008 CCHS and participants were linked to personal health records. There were approximately 1.3 million person-years of follow-up and over 15,000 deaths in the developmental dataset. Validation: This predictive risk model was validated using three different datasets: Ontario subset of the 2009 to 2012 CCHS, National dataset (except Ontario) of the 2003 to 2008 CCHS, and the National dataset of the 2000 and 2005 National Health Interview Survey in the United States of America. In all validation datasets individuals were linked to personal health records. Model: Two MPoRTs have been created: one for males and one for females. Each model is a cox-porportional hazard model that looks similar to: \\[ \\text{Mortality risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Where: \\(t\\) = survival time \\(h_0(t)\\) = the baseline hazard \\(\\beta_{pred}\\) = predictive hazard ratios for the exposures \\(x\\) = the exposure. The exposure can be continuous (e.g. age) or categorical (e.g. smoking status).
