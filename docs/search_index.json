The tool was developed in response to requests from public health departments to create, replicate, and update health status reports such as Public Health Ontario’s Seven More Years report which examined the impact of health behaviours on health outcomes: mortality and life expectancy. We hope you find the tool helpful for your research and policy planning, including the development and evaluation of population-based health interventions. The tool can help you to: Determine who in the Canadian population is at risk of dying Predict the number of new deaths in different Canadian populations Determine how much a risk factor contributes to a health outcome Assess the health benefits of potential interventions Examples questions the tool can answer The Project Big Life Planning Tool can answer the following types of questions: What is the life expectancy of people in British Columbia across different levels of educational attainment? How many deaths would be prevented if people in Ottawa biked as much as people in Copenhagen? What is the burden of smoking on life expectancy in Canada? How many deaths would be prevented if everyone in Winnipeg increased their daily exercise by 10%? The tool, which is well-suited to calculate health burdens for a range of social and demographic groups, provides a resource to examine inequities associated with health behaviours.(Manuel et al. 2016) The ability to examine the impact of different types of preventive scenarios is also supported &amp;mdash including population strategies that have a small incremental change in health behaviours for a broad target population or high-risk strategies with a larger change in health behaviours that target a smaller number of high-risk people.(Manuel D 2012) How it works The wide range of enhanced surveillance applications is made possible through the tool’s use of multivariable predictive algorithms. All algorithms used by the planning tool were developed and validated using data routinely collected by Statistics Canada and provincial health agencies, and the algorithms have been published in various journals. More information about the algorithms can be found in the Background, Key concepts and Appendices. Why should I use the tool? It is easy and flexible to use. The user only needs to upload their data and choose which calculation to run. It can be used to assess the future risk of a health outcome. It can be used to assess the effectiveness of different intervention scenarios (e.g., policy) on a health outcome. It is robust and flexible. It can be used to examine health outcomes in a range of social and demographic groups. It generates accurate predictions. The tool’s algorithms have been published in peer-review journals, validated in the Canadian population for a wide range of populations, and are publicly available. It is private. Loaded data remains on your computer and is not uploaded or sent anywhere. D Bibilography "],
["background.html", "Chapter 2 Background", " Chapter 2 Background The wide range of enhanced surveillance applications is made possible through the tool’s multivariable predictive approach. Compared to traditional approaches, the statistical and machine learning algorithms used by the PBL Planning Tool are a more complex approach to measure the burden from health behaviours.(Manuel et al. 2016) However, the planning tool carries out those complex calculators for you, without the need for statistical software. Calculations are performed on a population sample of individuals rather than the traditional approach of using aggregated data. The predictive algorithms use the distinct characteristics of each respondent in the database, rather than assuming a person’s risk of a health outcome (e.g., death) is the saame for all respondents with the same age and sex. The algorithms available on the planning tool have been developed and validated using data routinely-collected by Statistics Canada and provincial health agencies. All algorithms have been published in peer-review journals and are publicly available. More information about multivariable predictive risk algorithms can be found in the key concepts and appendices. Features and contributing The PBL Planning Tool is currently a pilot project. You can view changes and new features in the website’s Change Log. We welcome suggestions and issues. Please follow this guide. Please tell us if you have scenarios or uses of the planning tool that you want to share with others by commenting on this GitHub issue. Acknowledgements The PBL Planning Tool was developed by the Project Big Life Team based at the Ottawa Hospital and the Bruyère Research Institute. The tool was made in collaboration with Public Health Ontario, the Population Health Analytics Lab at the University of Toronto and Ottawa Public Health. Tool development was supported by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care through the Applied Health Research Question program, administered through ICES. Algorithms used in the planning tool were developed using linked population data housed at ICES and validated at Statistics Canada. All algorithms have been published in peer-review journals.

["getting-started.html", "Chapter 3 Getting Started", " Chapter 3 Getting Started To help you get started quickly with Project Big Life’s Planning Tool, we built a Tutorial directly onto the web application. The tutorial takes you through step-by-step how to use Project Big Life’s Planning Tool. The tutorial will not explain the steps in detail) nor will it provide terminology glossary or how the tool operates, but it will give you an understanding of how easy it is to use the Planning Tool! To access the tutorial, go onto Project Big Life’s Planning Tool and click on the Tutorial button in the top right corner! Data requirements The tool uses the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), Canada’s main population health survey administered by Statistics Canada. Information about the CCHS can be found here. The tool supports the CCHS 2013 PUMF or Shared files. Information for how to access the CCHS data can be found here. The Canadian university community can also access the CCCHS through Odesi – See health/Canada/Canadian Community Health Survey. The web application provides two CCHS data samples that can be accessed directly in the web application. These two data samples are synthetic data that do not represent actual respondents. For this reason, the results should not be used other than for demonstration purposes. Web browser support The PBL Planning Tool is a web application with all calculations performed on your desktop within the web browswer. Once loaded on your desktop, no connection to the Internet is required. Please contact the development team if work within a secure research environment without Internet access.

["customize-data.html", "4.1 Customize Data", " 4.1 Customize Data Note: The Project Big Life Planning Tool can only be used with the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) or Shared versions in ‘.csv’ format. Other population health surveys can be used only if the required variables are transformed to the specifications of the 2013/2014 CCHS data. Please note that the Project Big Life team is in the process of supporting CCHS versions from 2001 to 2013. Prior to using the Project Big Life Planning Tool you may want to transform your data set. Reasons include: customized filter(s) and/or customized stratification(s), and transforming variables from other population health surveys to the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) format. Any variable that you create can be selected within the planning tool in the filter and/or stratify options. Data manipulation can occur on any programming software: R, SAS, STATA, etc, as long as you output your data set as a ‘.csv’ file. 4.1.1 Customize filter and/or stratification An example of customizing your data set is converting the variable: Body Mass Index (CCHS 2013/2014 variable HWTGBMI) from a continuous variable into four distinct categories: Underweight: BMI less then 18.5 Normal or Healthy Weight: BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 Overweight: BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 Obese: BMI greater or equal to 30.0 Steps The following steps show the R code that would be used to create these strata: Convert observations “Not stated” from 999.99 to NA data[data == 999.99] &lt;- NA Load the R package dpylr. This package is used for data manipulation. library(dpylr) Create a new column that contains four categories for BMI data$newcolumn &lt;- cut(data$HWTGBMI, breaks = c(0,18.5,25,30,Inf), labels=c(&quot;Underweight&quot;, &quot;Healthy&quot;, &quot;Overweight&quot;, &quot;Obese&quot;) The output will be your data set + a new column with the corresponding category (“Underweight”, “Healthy”, “Overweight”, “Obese”) for that individual. HWTGBMI newcolumn 1 22.68 Healthy 2 26.99 Overweight 3 NA &lt;NA&gt; 4 34.44 Obese 5 23.77 Healthy 6 17.23 Underweight This new column can be now be used with the Project Big Life Planning Tool for the purpose of filtering or stratification. ###Transforming variables to 2013/2014 CCHS format Population health surveys other then the 2013/2014 CCHS PUMF or Shared files can be used if the variables: sex, age and survey weight (required variables) are transformed to the 2013/2014 CCHS format. For example the 2005/2006 CCHS data the age variable is titled DHHEGAGE and in the 2013/2014 CCHS data it is DHHGAGE. Although the variable’s name changes the data is captured identically in the 2005/2006 and 2013/2014 surveys. Therefore you can use the 2005/2006 CCHS data if you transform this variable to the 2013/2014 format. library(dpylr) CCHSdata.2005.2006 &lt;- CCHSdata.2005.2006 %&gt;% rename(DHHGAGE = DHHEGAGE) All required variables must be transformed to the 2013/2014 CCHS format. It is also recommended that you transform the recommend variables as well to increase the accuracy of the prediction(s). When transforming required or recommended variables pay attention to how the variables are captured. There may be differences limit the ability to use the data set or that will affect your results. For instance from the 2001-2004 CCHS survey there are 15 age categories but from 2005-2013 there are 16 age categories. "],
["load-data.html", "4.2 Load data", " 4.2 Load data Note: The Project Big Life Planning Tool can currently only support .csv data files from the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). Both the 2013/2014 CCHS PUMF and Shared file are accepted. Data loaded to the Project Big Life Planning Tool: Must include all the required variables: DDH_SEX (sex), DHHGAGE (age), and WTS_M (survey weight). Should include some or all of the recommended variables. Recommended variables aren’t required for calculations but will increase the accuracy of the predicted health outcome. More information on the required and recommended variables can be found Appendix. Only one data file can be used on the planning tool at a time; the planning tool cannot preform a calculation across multiple data files. If you wish to use data from different data sets, you first merge the data sets together and use the 2013/2014 CCHS format (e.g. variable names). Once data sets are merged into one data file you can load your data on to the Planning Tool. Note: Data you load to the Project Big Life Planning Tool remains on your computer and is not uploaded or sent anywhere. There are two options of data files: a sample file or your own file. 4.2.1 Load sample files If you don’t have your own data or want to explore the platform’s capabilities before using your data, you can use the sample file on the Project Big Life Planning Tool. There are two sample files included on the planning tool: sample.csv (Sample) this is fabricated data set that includes all variables required for calculation, recommend for calculation, and needed for the case examples. This data set is based on the 2013/2014 CCHS PUMF but it is entirely fabricated and can only be used for examplary purposes. sample_small.csv (Sample) is the same data set as above but has fewer observations. Use this data set if you are testing out the platform as it will take less time to compute. Steps Click on the checkmark beside the “Sample file” to select it. 4.2.2 Load your own file Steps Click the Browse button under “Select a file to use in calculations”. Locate the file on your computer, select, and open. Choose the file type (2013/2014 PUMF or 2013/2014 Shared) for your uploaded file, in the table that showcases all of the files. Note: If the loaded file has all of the variables required and recommended for calculation, you will be able to continue with the planning tool. If the loaded file does not have all the variables required for the calculation you will not be able to continue with the planning tool. If the loaded file does not have all the variables recommended for calculation you will be able to continue with the planning tool, however the calculations may be less accurate. "],

["run-scenarios.html", "4.6 Run scenarios", " 4.6 Run scenarios Scenarios can be used to predict the health outcomes when unhealthy behaviours: are modified in the population: Intervention, or were never present in the population: health behaviour attribution Scenarios can be used to inform potential health policies or programs. 4.6.1 Intervention scenarios Interventions provide you with the ability to customize the scenarios. For example you can answer the questions: what if we only had 15% of the population smoked rather then the current 20%? what if everyone increased their physical activity by 10%? what if everyone ate 4 fruit servings each day? what if everyone drank 2 fewer drinks per week? These intervention scenarios allow you to predict and compare the effectiveness of policies. There are 3 types of intervention scenarios that you can select: Absolute: each individual in the population changes their health behaviour by a value of x. Relative: each individual in the population changes their health behaviour by a ratio of y. Target: each individual in the population has a set value of z. More information on the specifics of each type of intervention scenario and how they are calculated can be found in key concepts - “Scenarios: Interventions”. Steps Click the box beside either “Life Expectancy (Summary)” under the “Calculation” drop down. Check the button beside: “Intervention” under the “Scenario” drop down. Click on the health behaviour you want to modify: e.g. Diet. A drop down menu of all the possible variables of that health behaviour you can modify will appear. Click the box beside the variable you want to modify: e.g. Daily consumption - fruit - (D). A drop down menu of the scenario types: absolute, relative, and target, will appear.

Assumption #1: we assume individuals 65 or older are retired and therefore not cycling to/from work/school. Therefore, we will only evaluate individuals that are &lt; 65 years old. In order to calculate the average Canadian daily energy expenditure from cycling for transportation, you will need to: Find the average number of times, that an individual cycled to/from work/school in the past 3 months (mean PAC_8A) Find the average number of hours spent cycling to/from work/school, in the past 3 month (mean of PAC_8B) Calculate the average duration of cycling: \\(\\text{Duration} = [\\text{(Frequency/3 months)}*\\text{(Time/trip)}] / \\text{(Days/3 months)}\\) Calculate the average daily energy expenditure (MET-hours) for cycling to/from work/school: \\(\\text{MET-hours} = \\text{Duration}*\\text{MET value for cycling}\\) Note: For Canadians to cycle like the Dutch, we need to use the Dutch MET cycling value of 5.8 and not the Canadian MET cycling value of 4.0. The Dutch MET value accounts for the speed of cycling of the Dutch. Calculation the average daily expenditure from cycling for transportation for all individuals in the population not only those that cycled to/from work/school On average a Canadian only gets 0.024 MET-hours/day from cycling to/from work/school. 5.4.2 Part B: How much do the Dutch cycle/day for transportation purposes on average? Using data collected as part of the Dutch National Travel Survey (2010 – 2012), Fisherman, 2015 (doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0121871 - Table S1) reported the average additional daily energy expenditure from cycling as a form of transportation for the Dutch: males: 1.3 MET-hours, and females: 1.4 MET-hours. The average Dutch daily energy expenditure from cycling as a form of transportation for both sexes is then 1.35 MET-hours. 5.4.3 Part C: What is the average difference in daily cycling transporation for Canadians and the Dutch? Canadians need to increase their average daily energy expenditure from cycling from 0.07 MET-hours to 1.35 MET-hours, in order to be like the Dutch. Note: Since the physical activity intervention scenario on the Project Big Life Planning Tool is for daily leisure energy expenditure and not daily active transportation, we will use the ‘absolute’ scenario for this example. We will increase each individual’s daily leisure energy expenditure by 1.28 MET-hours (1.35 MET-hours - 0.07 MET-hours). 5.4.4 Part D: Predict how Canadian life expectancy would change if Canadians biked like the Dutch. Use the Project Big Life Planning Tool for the following steps: Load your data file: data.sample.csv to the Project Big Life Planning Tool. Select initial calculation: Summary Measure – Life Expectancy (Summary) Add Filter: DDHGAGE – 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 Click: Scenarios, and select Intervention Click Physical Activity then Select “Average daily leisure time energy expenditure in METs” Assumption #2: Although the scenario for physical activity is for leisure energy expenditure, we assume 1) individuals that are active in their leisure time also use active transportation, and 2) cycling as a form of active transportation is minor part of their energy expenditure. Therefore we will adjust the average daily leisure time energy expenditure in METs. Select Absolute Type in the absolute change calculated in Part 3, into the text box.

The CCHS is an annual cross-sectional survey preformed by Statistics Canada. The CCHS collects information related to health status, health care utilization, and health determinants for the Canadian population. Data is shared at the the sub-provincial geographic level (health region or combination of health regions). Details about the survey and its design can be found on Statistic Canada website (http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;Id=144170). Details and access to the Public Use Microdata file (PUMF) can be found through the Odesi website (https://search2.odesi.ca/#/details?uri=%2Fodesi%2Fcchs-82M0013-E-2013-2014-Annual-component.xml) 6.1.2 Why can the Project Big Life Planning Tool only accept the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey data? Each year the CCHS changes a few variables it captures. This makes CCHS data sets from every year other then 2013/2014 partly incompatible with the algorithms used by the Project Big Life Planning Tool. The Project Big Life Planning Team is currently working to adjust the algorithms so that they accept CCHS year: 2001 to 2014, and will update this guidance. 6.1.3 Can I use other population health survey data sets? Yes you can use other population health survey data sets but you have to transform these data set to the 2013/2014 CCHS format. 6.1.4 Sample Files data.sample.csv this is synthetic data set that includes all variables required for calculation, recommend for calculation, and needed for the case examples (found in Chapter 5). While this data set was model on the response rates of the 2013/2014 CCHS PUMF (e.g. approximately 80% of respondents did not have high blood pressure (CCC_071)), the data is fabricated.

Multivariable predictive risk algorithms can be used to: Project the number of new cases of the health outcome Estimate the contribution of specific risk factors of the health outcome Evaluate effectiveness of health interventions Describe the distribution of risk in the population (diffused or concentrated) Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are able to assess equity issues compared to competing population risk methods (e.g. World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease). More information on what multivariable predictive risk algorithms are and how they can be used can be found the journal article: Predictive risk algorithms in a population setting: an overview (Manuel D 2012) 6.2.1 Development of multivariable predictive risk algorithms Data: Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are created using routinely collected data that includes information about risk factors (exposure) and health events (outcomes). Data is collected at an individual level through population health surveys (e.g. Canadian Community Health Survey) and administrative databases (e.g. Vital Statistics). Data sources are linked together when the individual has given permission too. Individuals are followed overtime until the health event (e.g. death or disease) occurs. Separate data is collected to create a derivation cohort and validation cohort(s). Note: The risk factors that are collected are from population health surveys and are self-reported; no clinical data (e.g. blood pressure) is collected. Risk factors focus on health behaviours (e.g. smoking) and sociodemographic factors, commonly associated with health outcome. Algorithm generation: Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are cox proportional hazard models that analyze time to health outcome (e.g. death) Question for Carol - The models are not cox-porportional hazard models but they are similar? Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are developed and validated in 4 stages: Algorithm derivation: the predictive risk algorithm is created using data from the derivation cohort Algorithm validation: the predictive risk algorithm is applied to the validation cohort Final algorithm generation: validation and derivation cohorts are combined to estimate the final application of the predictive risk algorithm Derivation of the application algorithm: creation of a parsimonous (fewer predictors) algorithm that maintained discrimination, calibration, and overall algorithm performance In each stage of the algorithm development and validation, algorithm performance is assessed using measures of discrimination and calibration. 6.2.2 Multivariable predictive risk algorithms built in Project Big Life Planning Tool There is currently 1 multivariable predictive risk algorithm is built into to Project Big Life planning tool.

["calculations.html", "6.3 Calculations", " 6.3 Calculations 6.3.1 Summary vs By Row There are two general types of calculations Summary Measures and By Row Measures. Summary measures: When selected, the result will be a single measure for the entire dataset. For instance when Summary Measure - Life Expectancy (Summary Measure) is selected the result is a single life expectancy at birth for the given for the population. By row measures: When selected, the result will be the measurement for each individual (e.g. row) in the dataset. Note: Summary Measures are not the same as taking the average of By Row Measures. Summary measures account for the survey weights in their calculations. Only averaging the By Row Measures does not account for the survey weights and will result in an incorrect outcome. 6.3.2 Weighted vs unweighted Weights are used in complex surveys like the Canadian Community Healthy Survey (CCHS). A weight is given to each respondent in the survey and the weight corresponds to the number of individuals in the population the respondent represents. When a data set has weights, like the CCHS PUMF data set, the weights are used to calculate the population’s outcome e.g. number of deaths. When a survey does not have weights, the the population’s outcome is not calculated with weights. In either case, weights are not used in the calculation of an individual’s outcome (e.g. an individual’s 5 year risk of mortality). "],
["calculations-specific-health-outcomes.html", "6.4 Calculations: specific health outcomes", " 6.4 Calculations: specific health outcomes 6.4.1 Risk of health outcome Risk of the health outcome (e.g. risk of dying) is the outcome of a multivariable predictive risk algorithm. An example of the mutlivariable risk algorithm is: \\[ \\text{Risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Where: \\(t\\) = survival time \\(h_0(t)\\) = the baseline hazard \\(\\beta_{pred}\\) = predictive hazard ratios for the exposures \\(x\\) = the exposure. The exposure can be continuous (e.g. age) or categorical (e.g. smoking status). Categorical exposures are represented by dummy/factor variables. Each category has its own beta and the exposure is binary. For example smoking status is categorical variable with categories: current, former &lt;= 5 years, former &gt;5 years, or never smoked. For \\(\\beta_{pred.current.smoker}\\) the exposure: \\(x_{current.smoker}\\) = 1 if the individual currently smokes or 0 if the individual is another type of smoker. 6.4.2 Number of health outcomes The number of health outcomes (e.g. summary - deaths) is calculated through the following steps: Risk of the health outcome is calculated for each individual (row) in the data set using the mutlivariable predictive risk algorithm. Each individual’s (row) risk is weighted with their corresponding survey weight (CCHS PUMF = WTS_M and CCHS shared file = WTS_S). The weighted mean of the health outcome (e.g. mean risk of death) is calculated. The weighted mean is then multiplied with the total number of individuals in the population to generate the number of health outcomes (e.g. number of deaths in 5 years). 6.4.3 Life expectancy Life expectancy is calculated using abridge life tables using a modified Chaing approach (Chiang 1984) (Hsieh 1991). (link to reference for Chiang and Hsieh and also one of our papers). Life expectancy is calculated by two methods: one for summary life expectancy, and a second for by row life expectancy. 6.4.3.1 Summary Life Expectancy Life expectancy is calculated separately for males and females. Males: The mortality risk for each male individual is calculated using the male mortality mutlivariable predictive risk algorithm for mortality (MPoRT). Details about the MPoRT can be found in Appendix A. Male individuals are grouped into the 5-year age groups that are used in the 5-year abridge life tables (e.g. 40-44 years old). The weighted average risk of death for each age group is calculated. A male 5-year abridge life table is created using the weighted average risks of death (q(x)) for each age group and the median age for the age group. Females Steps 1-4 used to calculate life expectancy for males, are repeated for females using the female MPoRT and a female 5-year abridge life table. Summary life expectancy The summary life expectancy, or life expectancy of the entire population, is calculated by adding the male life expectancy with the female life expectancy, and taking its average. Summary life expectancy by strata Steps (1-4) are repeated for each strata. There will be strata specific weighted risk of death and strata specific life tables. Step 5 is repeated with the average life expectancy calculated across all strata. 6.4.3.2 By row life expectancy An individual’s life expectancy is calculated by creating a new life table specific to that individual. These life tables are 1-year abridge life tables, and begin at the individual’s age (e.g. an individual that is 43 years old, will have the life table start at 43 years). The probability of death for a person’s current age is calculated using the respective MPoRT (male or female), and the individual’s health profile (e.g. never smoked, 15 drinks weekly, has hypertension, is a Canadian Citizen, etc) (e.g. \\(q_x\\), where \\(x=43\\)). The probability of death is recalculated for incremental older ages (additional rows of the life table) up to age 90 years ( \\(q_\\text{(x+1)}, q_\\text{(x+2)}...q_{90}\\)). For each life table row, age is the only variable that is changed for MPoRT risk calculation. Note: The result for By Row Life Expectancy are the predicted years of life that the individual still has left to live based on thier age (e.g. 43). To calculate age of death, add the respondent’s age to their by row life expectancy estimate. Note: By row life expectancy does not account for the individual’s weight, and therefore can not be used to estimate the summary life expectancy. D Bibilography "],
["scenario-intervention.html", "6.5 Scenario: Intervention", " 6.5 Scenario: Intervention How would life expectancy change if everyone increased their physical activity levels by 10%? The health intervention scenario allows you to predict how changing the health behaviours: alcohol consumption, diet, physical activity, and smoking, of a population will affect the population health outcome (e.g. life expectancy). This feature can be used to predict the effectiveness of proposed policies or programs. There are three types of scenarios: absolute, relative, and target. Absolute: each individual in the population changes their health behaviour by a value of x. Relative: each individual in the population changes their health behaviour by a ratio of y. Target: each individual in the population has a set value of z. For target scenarios if the individual’s value is already at the target value or beyond the target value then their value is not changed. E.g. If the target value for physical activity is 2.5 METs/day, then any individual that already has METs/day &gt;= 2.5 METs/week then there value will not be adjusted. The changes for each type of scenario for alcohol, physical activity, and diet are described in the following table: Health.Behaviour Absolute.change Relative.change Target Each individual changes … Each individual changes … Each individual has the value … Alcohol Consumption the number of drinks they have per week by x the number of drinks they have per week by y % z drinks per week Physical Activity their physical activity level by x METs per day their physical activity level by y % METs per day z METs per day Diet the number of servings of fruits and vegetables they eat by x per day the number servings of fruits and vegetables they eat by y % per day z fruits and vegetables per day the number of glasses of juice they drink by x per week the number of glasses of juice by y % per day z glasses of juice per day the number of servings of potatoes the eat by x per week the number of potatoes they eat by y % per day z potatoes per day The smoking health intervention scenario is different then the other types of health intervention scenarios as they adjust the prevalence of the health behaviour.

This scenario is a health behaviour attribution scenario. A health behaviour attribution scenario: predicts the health outcome if no one was exposed to the health behaviour = health behaviour-deleted outcome, and estimates the effect the health behaviour has on the health outcome for the population = health behaviour attributable outcome To understand health behaviour attribution scenarios lets use the example of smoking and deaths for a population. The number of deaths for a population is calculated twice: with the population that has all smokers = baseline deaths, and with a counterfactual scenario where everyone in the population is non-smokers = smoking-deleted deaths The difference between the number of deaths for of the two populations is the smoking attributable deaths. Figure 6.2: Health behaviour attributable scenario - Deaths In this example smoking attributes approximately 15,000 deaths in the population. This can also be done with life expectancy. Life expectancy is calculated: with the population that has all smokers = baseline life expectancy, and with the counterfactual population where there are no smokers = smoking-deleted life expectancy. The difference between the life expectancy of the two populations is the life expectancy lost due to smoking.

Therefore individuals that live: in long-term care facilities, First Nations reserves, incarcerated populations, and full-time members of the Canadian Forces were excluded. The exclusion of these individuals is likely to lead to a small under-estimation of the burden of a health behaviour on a health outcome. Excluded populations have higher prevalence of unhealthy behaviours like smoking: incarerated and First Nations have higher prevelance of current smoking and individuals in long-term care facilities are more likely to be former smokers then the general population. However this under-estimation is small as the excluded population only accounts for &lt; 3% of the Canadian population. 6.8.1.2 Reporting of health behaviours Self-reported data is used to health surveys use self-reported data to predict risk and health outcomes. With self-reported surveys there is the possibility of social desirability bias, where respondents tend to over-report what they perceive to be healthy behaviours and under-report what they perceive to be unhealthy behaviours. This is particularly the case with alcohol, where there is a consistent under-reporting of alcohol consumption in most population health surveys. In Ontario, the sum of self-reported alcohol consumption is about half the volume of alcohol sold {Rehm J (2006)}. In addition the full spectrum of the behaviour has not been captured due to limited questions about the health behaviour in surveys. With diet there were few questions on the CCHS survey and these questions only asked about frequency of diet components. Information on diet factors like quantity, sodium intake, trans fat, or other healthy/unhealthy behaviours were not captured. It is likely that the burden of poor diet is under-estimated. Although more accurate risk factor ascertainment could improve discriminiation and calibration of the algorithms used in the Project Big Life Planning Tool, these algorithms already have high discrimination and calibration. 6.8.2 Limitation: Multivariable predictive risk algorithms 6.8.2.1 Hazard ratios and exposures are assumed constant The hazard ratios in the algorithms of the Project Big Life Planning Tool, and an individual’s exposures are assumed to be constant. Constant hazard ratios do not account for period effect which could lead to an over-estimation of the burden of a health behaviour e.g. the differential mortality between smokers and non-smokers may have been greater for older periods, Therefore the algorithms do not account for any period effects. 6.8.3 Limitation: Calculations 6.8.3.1 Uncertainty 6.8.3.2 Attributable risk calculations 6.8.4 Limitation: Using the Project Big Life Planning Tool D Bibilography "],

If the entire column for the variable is missing then the calculation cannot be performed on the data. If there are missing row entries for the variable then the entire row will not be used in the calculation. Filter Chooses part of your dataset for analysis. If you filter on ‘Sex’ and then ‘Male’, calculations will only be performed on individuals that are ‘Male’ and ‘Females’ will be excluded. For example, when calculating Life Expectancy on the filter variable ‘Sex’ then ‘Male’ there will be a Life Expectancy estimate for ‘Males’ and no Life Expectancy estimate for ‘Females’. Health Behaviour Actions people do that may affect their health, positively or negatively. Health behaviours are among the determinants of health and are influenced by the social, cultural and physical environments in which people live and work.(Statistics Canada 2010) They are also shaped by individual choices and external constraints.(Statistics Canada 2010) The four health behaviours of smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical activity are specified in Project Big Life’s planning tool. Health behaviour-deleted outcome The health behaviour-deleted outcome is the estimated health outcome in a counterfactual population where a specific health behaviour (e.g. smoking) never existed. For instance, everyone in the counterfactual population were are never smokers. Health behaviour attributable outcome The health behaviour attributable outcome represents the effect the health behaviour (e.g. smoking) has on the health outcome for a population. For example, smoking attributes to 30,000 deaths in the population or 30,000 deaths in the population are caused by smoking. Ignored Variables Are not included in the calculation. It does not matter if your dataset includes these variables or not. Ignored variables can used for filter and stratification. Life Expectancy (LE) Life expectancy is a calculation of how long a person or population would be expected to live, on average, given unchanging risk of death from a specific point in time. Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) The metabolic equivalent of task (MET) is a measure of the rate of energy expenditure from an activity; a measure of calories burned by type, duration and frequency of physical activity. The reference value of 1 MET is defined as the energy expediture rate at rest which is equal to 1kcal/kg/day. Predictor A variable that is used in the algorithm to predict the outcome. Recommend for calculation Variables that are included in the calculation but not necessary for the calculation to run. Rather these variables increase the accuracy of the results. Required for calculation Variables that are included in the calculations and are necessary for the calculation to run. If a dataset does not have these variables then the calculation will not run. Risk The probability ofa health event occuring at some point of time in the future. Socioeconomic Position People in poorer socioeconomic circumstances generally have poorer health. Deprivation measures identify those who experience material or social disadvantage compared to others in their community. The Deprivation Index for Health in Canada developed by the Institut national desanté publique du Québec (INSPQ)(Pampalon R, Raymond G 2000) is used in this plannning tool. The index includes education, employment and income as measures of material deprivation; and single-parent families, living alone, or being divorced, widowed or separated as measures of social deprivation. The deprivation index was used to assign geographical areas into socioeconomic position groups (low, middle and high) based on material and social quintiles. High-deprivation neighbourhoods were those in the top two quintiles for both social and material deprivation. Low-deprivation neighbourhoods were those in the bottom two quintiles. Stratification The seperation of data into smaller strata (levels or classes which individuals are assigned too). If the variable ‘Sex’ is stratified it creates two strata: ‘Male’ and ‘Female’. Calculations are performed on each strata (level or class) and the outcome will be specific to that strata. For example, when calculating Life Expectancy on the stratified variable ‘Sex’ there will be a Life Expectancy estimate for ‘Males’ and a different Life Expectancy estimate for ‘Females’. Stratification can only occur on categorical variables. Summary Measures When selected, the result will be a single measure for the entire dataset. For instance when Summary Measure - Life Expectancy (Summary Measure) is selected the result is a single life expectancy at birth for the given for the population. When stratifications are selected, the summary measure will be given for each strata. For instance when Summary Measure - Life Expectancy and Stratification - Sex are selected, then two life expectancy measures will be given one for males and one for females.

["descriptions-of-mport-versions.html", "A.2 Descriptions of MPoRT versions", " A.2 Descriptions of MPoRT versions Versions of MPoRT have been developed since 2012 and used in various studies. Each version of MPoRT (v1.0, v1.2, v2.0) used the Ontario subset of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) for development and the survey respondents were linked to personal death records. In later versions of MPoRT (v1.2, v2.0) the following changes were made:, (a) algorithm variables were adjusted to improve predictions, and (b) the algorithms were validated using: the Ontario subset of CCHS of the years that were not used in development and the National CCHS data set (excluding Ontario). MPoRTv1.0 Was used in the Seven More Years report, a joint report with Public Health Ontario and ICES . In summary, the algorithm estimated the risk of death associated with health behaviours: smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, poor diet, physical inactivity and stress. There were approximately 550,000 person-years of follow up and over 6000 deaths in the development data set. The algorithm used categorical predictor variables for health behaviours and sociodemographic factors. MPoRTv1.2 Was published in PLoS. In summary, the algorithm estimated the risk of death associated with health behaviours: smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, poor diet, and physical inactivity (stress was removed due to its low prediction ability). There were approximately 1 million person-years of follow up and over 9000 deaths in the development and validation data sets. The algorithm used multiple continuous predictor variables, and added chronic disease predictor variables and interaction terms. MPoRTv2.0 - Version in Project Big Life’s Planning Tool This version of MPoRT has not yet been published. Development: This predictive risk model was developed using Ontario subsets of the 2001 to 2008 CCHS and participants were linked to personal health records. There were approximately 1.3 million person-years of follow-up and over 15,000 deaths in the developmental data set. Validation: This predictive risk model was validated using three different data sets: Ontario subset of the 2009 to 2012 CCHS, National data set (except Ontario) of the 2003 to 2008 CCHS, and the National data set of the 2000 and 2005 National Health Interview Survey in the United States of America. In all validation data sets individuals were linked to personal health records. Model: Two MPoRTs have been created: one for males and one for females. Each model is a cox-proportional hazard model that looks similar to: \\[ \\text{Mortality risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Where: \\(t\\) = survival time \\(h_0(t)\\) = the baseline hazard \\(\\beta_{pred}\\) = predictive hazard ratios for the exposures \\(x\\) = the exposure. The exposure can be continuous (e.g. age) or categorical (e.g. smoking status). Parameters: The parameters used in this multivariable predictive risk model are: Category Variable Scale Description Demographic Age* Continous 5 knot spline. Valid range 20 to 102 Sex Dichotomous Stratified Female/Male Health Behaviour Pack years of smoking Continous 3 knot spline. Valid range: 0 to 78 (Female), 0 to 112.5 (Male) Smoking Status Categorical Non-smoker Current Smoker Former Smoker &lt;= 5 years Former &gt; 5 years Alcohol (number of drinks per week) Continous 4 knot spline (Females) and 3 knot spline (Males).

These include: pack-years of smoking, and the simplified diet score. Pack-years of smoking Pack-years of smoking is generated from: the type of smoker, age in which they started smoking daily, how many cigarettes they smoke daily, and if applicable the age in which they stopped smoking daily. Pack-years of smoking also includes: their age, the age of thier first cigarette, and whether throughout thier life they have smoked 100+ cigarettes. In summary, the more an individual smokes or the longer they smoke, the greater the pack-years of smoking. Simplified Diet Score The simplified diet score essentially adds the healthy diet variables together (daily servings of carrots, fruit, salad, vegetables) and subtracts the unhealthy diet variables (daily servings of juice and potato).

"],
["calculation.html", "B.1 Calculation", " B.1 Calculation There are two parts to the calculations preformed in health behaviour attributable scenarios: (A) calculate the risk, and (B) calculate the health outcome: life expectancy or number of deaths. B.1.1 Part A: Risk calculations The original multivariable predictive risk algorithm is: \\[ \\text{Risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Step 1. Modify the original algorithm to include the external coefficient(s). This means replacing all predictive hazard ratios/betas related to the health behaviour to the causal hazard ratios/betas. Remove the original regression coefficient(s) for the health behaviour. Add the new external coefficient(s) to the algorithm. External coefficients are generated from either: causal models, or from systematic reviews or meta-analysis. \\[ \\text{External coefficient risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{{\\beta_\\textbf{causal.smoking}}*x_{smoking} + {{\\beta_\\textbf{causal.cancer}}}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Step 2. Risk is calculated using the modified algorithm created in Step 1 and the respondent’s original profile (e.g. current smoker). This is the “external coefficient risk”. \\[ \\text{External coefficient risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{causal.smoking}* {(\\textbf{current smoker})} + \\beta_{causal.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Step 3. “Health behaviour-deleted risk’” is calculated by setting an exposure to a reference (non-exposed) value (all other risk exposures remain unchanged). \\[ \\text{Health behaviour-deleted risk&#39; } = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\\beta_{causal.smoking}* {(\\textbf{never smoker})} + \\beta_{causal.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Step 4. The “health behaviour attributable risk external” is calculated as “external coefficient risk” (Step 2) minus the “health behaviour-deleted risk’.”(Step 3). \\[\\text{Health behaviour attributable risk}_{external} = \\text{External coefficient risk} - \\text{Health behaviour-deleted risk&#39;}\\] Step 5. Original risk is calculated using the original algorithm and the original respondent’s profile. \\[ \\text{Original risk} = \\sum_t h_0(t) * e^{{\\beta_\\textbf{pred.smoking}}*{(\\textbf{current smoker})}+{\\beta_\\textbf{pred.cancer}}*x_{cancer} + \\beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...} \\] Step 6. The “health behaviour-deleted risk external” is calculated by “original risk” (Step 5) minus the “health behaviour-deleted effect external” (Step 4). \\[\\text{Health behaviour-deleted risk}_{ external} = \\text{Original risk} - \\text{Health behaviour attributable risk}_{external}\\] Figure B.1: Risk portion of the health behaviour attribution calculations B.1.2 Part B: Health outcome calculations Using risks generated above you can then calculate: Health behaviour-deleted life expectancy or health behaviour attributable life expectancy lost Health behaviour-deleted number of deaths or health behaviour attributable number of deaths Life expectancy calculations Step I: Calculate the original life expectancy by using the original risk (Step 5 above) in the sex-specific 5-year abridge period life tables. Step II: Calculate the health behaviour-deleted life expectancy by using the health behaviour-deleted risk external (Step 6 above) in the sex-specific 5-year abridge period life tables. Step III: Calculate the health behaviour attributable life expectancy lost by: original life expectancy (Step I) minus health behaviour-deleted life expectancy (Step II): \\[ \\text{Health behaviour attributable life exectancy lost} = \\text{Health behaviour-deleted life expectancy} - \\text{Original life expectancy}\\] Number of deaths calculations Step I: Calculate the number of deaths that would occur using the original risk (Step 5 above). Step II: Calculate the number of deaths that would occur using the health behaviour-deleted risk external (Step 6 above). Step III: Calculate the health behaviour attributable deaths by: original number of deaths (Step I) minus health behaviour-deleted number of deaths (Step II): \\[\\text{Health behaviour attributable deaths} = \\text{Original number of deaths} - \\text{Health behaviour-deleted number of deaths}\\] "],
["additional-considerations.html", "B.2 Additional considerations", " B.2 Additional considerations B.2.1 Health behaviours with non-monotonic relationships Health behaviours with relationships that are non-monotonic (always increasing or always decreasing) can be used in health behaviour attributable calculations but special consideration may be warranted for both policy and analytic reasons. An example of a health behaviour with a non-monotonic relationship is alcohol. Some studies suggest that there is a “J” shaped risk relationship for outcomes such as cardiovascular disease. Is this still a consideration if we are using 0 as the reference value? Need to complete the thought at the end of the paragraph Alcohol drinking guidelines usually do not recommend people: non-drinkers or former-drinkers, initiate drinking. In this situation, the target population for health behaviour attribution calculations can be restricted to for respondents with moderate or higher drinking, or multiple reference exposures could be created. B.2.2 Health behaviours with interactions or multiple coefficients The health behaviour attributable risk and the health behaviour-deleted risk estimates can be calculated for health behaviours with interaction terms, including complex interactions or multiple coefficients. Examples include: health behaviour parametes with age interaction; spline functions with terms for each knot point; or, composite risks such as smoking which may coefficients for smoking status (current, former, never) and pack-years. All coefficients that related to a common risk factor should be simultaneously considered. B.2.3 Exposures not in the original algorithm "],
