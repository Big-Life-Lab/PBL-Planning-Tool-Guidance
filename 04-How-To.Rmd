##Customize Data

Prior to using the Project Big Life Planning Tool you may want to manipulate your data set. Reasons include: customized filter(s) and/or customized stratification(s). 

Data manipulation can occur on any programming software: R, SAS, STATA, etc, as long as you output your data set as a '.csv' file. 

An example of customizing your data set is converting the variable: Body Mass Index (CCHS 2013 variable HWTGBMI) from a continuous variable into four distinct categories:
    
- Underweight: BMI less then 18.5
- Normal or Healthy Weight: BMI of 18.5 to 24.9
- Overweight: BMI of 25.0 to 29.9
- Obese: BMI greater or equal to 30.0

**Steps**

The following steps show the R code that would be used to create these strata:

1. Convert observations "Not stated" from 999.99 to NA
```    
    data[data == 999.99] <- NA
```      
2. Load the R package dpylr. This package is used for data manipulation.
```
    library(dpylr)
```       
3. Create a new column that contains four categories for BMI
``` 
    data$newcolumn <- cut(data$HWTGBMI, breaks = c(0,18.5,25,30,Inf),  labels=c("Underweight", "Healthy", "Overweight", "Obese")
``` 
4. The output will be your data set + a new column with the corresponding category ("Underweight", "Healthy", "Overweight", "Obese") for that individual.

```
    HWTGBMI   newcolumn
  1   22.68     Healthy
  2   26.99  Overweight
  3      NA        <NA>
  4   34.44       Obese
  5   23.77     Healthy
  6   17.23 Underweight
```

This new column can be now be used with the Project Big Life Planning Tool for the purpose of filtering or stratification.



##Load data 

Only one data set can be used on the platform for each calculation; a calculation cannot be preformed across multiple data sets.

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** Data sets loaded to the Project Big Life Planning Tool remains on your computer and is not uploaded or sent anywhere.
</div>

There are two options for your data: use a sample file or load your own file. 

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** The Project Big Life Planning Tool can currently only support .csv data files from the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey. Both the PUMF and Shared 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey files are accepted.
</div>

- More information on the Canadian Community Health Survey and the types of accepted data can be found in Key concepts (Chapter \@ref(keyconcepts)) - "Data and Sample Files".
 

###Load sample files

If you don't have your own data or want to explore the platform's capabilities before using your data, you can use the sample files on the Project Big Life Planning Tool. There are **X** sample files you may use:

- **data.sample.csv** this is fabricated dataset that includes all variables required for calculation, recommend for calculation, and needed for the real life application examples (found in Chapter 5). This data set is based on the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey Public Use Microdata File from, however this data set was created only for example purposes and **cannot** be used for analysis.


**Steps**

1. Click on the file name under "Sample files" to select it. 


###Load your own file

**Steps**

1. Click the **Browse** button under "Select a file to use in calculations".

2. Locate the file on your computer, select, and open. 

- If the loaded file has all of the variables required and recommended for calculation, you will be able to continue with the planning tool. 
  
- If the loaded file does **not** have all the variables **required** for the calculation you will not be able to continue with the planning tool.
  
- If the loaded file does **not** have all the variables **recommended** for calculation you will be able to continue with the planning tool, however the calculations may be less accurate. 



##Select calculation

There are two general types of calculations: summary measures and by row measures.

- **Summary measures:** (ref:Summarycalc)

- **By row measures:** (ref:byrowcalc)

Summary measures must be selected for calculations that have stratifications, intervention scenarios, and  cause-deleted scenario.

**Steps**

1. Check the box beside the calculation's name under "Calculations" to select it. A single calculation or multiple calculations may be selected.

  - Once selected the name(s) of the calculation(s) will appear to the right of "Calculations".

More details of what the calculations are and how they are preformed can be found in key concepts (Chapter \@ref(keyconcepts)) - "Calculations".


##Filter data

Use filters when you want to analyze only a subset of your data.

**Steps**

1. Click on the **+ New** button under "Filters".

2. Select the variable that you want to filter on by typing its variable name into the "search variables" text bar.

3. Filter **in** the categories/levels within the variable by:

  - **Categorical:** Clicking on the "Search categories"" text bar. Scroll and select the category you want to **keep** in your data. Repeat this step to add additional categories.

  - **Continous:** Click the "cycle button" found under the variable you have selected. Two new boxes will appear. 
    - Select the minimum value for your subset data in the box on the left by typing the values or using the arrows. 
    - Select the maximum value for your subset data in the box on your right by typing the value or using the arrows.
    
4. To add another filter repeat the steps above. A maximum of three filters are recommended to maintain statistical power (added filters reduce sample sizes and reduces statistical power). 

  - Once selected, the name(s) of the filtered variable(s) will appear to the right of "Filters".

You are able to filter on all types of variables: required for calculation, recommended for calculation, and ignore variables (includes customized variables).


###Remove a filter

- To remove a filter entirely, click on the trash can beside the variable you want to delete.

- To remove a level within a filtered variable - categorical, click on the 'x' beside the variable level.


##Stratify data

Use stratifications when you want to get a result for multiple strata (levels or classes). 

A summary measure must be selected for stratifications, as only a summary measure will be outputted for each strata. By row measurements may also be selected but they will not be stratified.

**Steps**

1. Click the box beside either "Life Expectancy (Summary)" or "Deaths (Five Years)" under the "Calculation" drop down.

2. Select the variables you want to stratify on under the "Stratifications'. You are only able to stratify on categorical variables.

3. To add another variable for stratification repeat the steps above. A maximum of 3 stratifications are recommended to maintain statistical power (added strata reduce strata sample size and reduces statistical power).

- Once selected, the name(s) of the stratified variable(s) will appear to the right of "Stratifications".

You are able to stratify on all types of categorical variables: required for calculation, recommended for calculation, and ignore variables (includes customized variables).

###Remove a stratification

- To remove a stratification variable click on the 'x' beside the variable level.



##Run scenarios

Scenarios can be used to predict the health outcomes when unhealthy behaviours:

- are modified in the population: **Intervention**, or
- were never present in the population: **Cause-deleted**

Scenarios can be used to inform potential health policies or programs.

###Intervention scenarios

Interventions provide you with the ability to customize the scenarios. For example you can answer the questions:

- what if we only had 15% of the population smoked rather then the current 20%?
- what if everyone increased their physical activity by 10%?
- what if everyone ate 4 fruit servings each day?
- what if everyone drank 2 fewer drinks per week?

These intervention scenarios allow you to predict and compare the effectiveness of policies.

There are 3 types of intervention scenarios that you can select:

- **Absolute:** each individual in the population **changes** their health behaviour **by a value of x**. 
- **Relative:** each individual in the population **changes** their health behaviour **by a ratio of y**.
- **Target:** each individual in the population **has a set value of z.**

More information on the specifics of each type of intervention scenario and how they are calculated can be found in Key Concepts (Chapter \@ref(keyconcepts)) - "Scenarios: Interventions".

**Steps**

1. Click the box beside either "Life Expectancy (Summary)" under the "Calculation" drop down.

2. Check the button beside: "Intervention" under the "Scenario" drop down.

3. Click on the health behaviour you want to modify: e.g. Diet.

- A drop down menu of all the possible variables of that health behaviour you can modify will appear.

4. Click the box beside the variable you want to modify: e.g. Daily consumption - fruit - (D).

- A drop down menu of the scenario types: absolute, relative, and target, will appear.

5. Check the button beside the type of intervention you want to modify: e.g. Target.

6. Use the arrows beside the the text box: "Decrease by" or "Increase by" to add the value you are modifying: e.g. The value of 4 is used for the scenario what if everyone ate 4 fruit servings each day?

Multiple health behaviours and variables within the health behaviours can be selected for a single calculation.

- Once selected, the name(s) of the health behaviour(s) that have been selected for the intervention will appear to the right of "Scenario".

###Cause-deleted scenarios

Cause-deleted scenarios provide you with the ability to see the best case scenario for the population. For example:

- what if no one in the population ever smoked?
- what if everyone in the population met their recommended physical activity levels (3.00 METs/week)?

More information on cause-deleted calculations and how they are calculated can be found in key concepts (_Chapter \@ref(keyconcepts)_) - "Scenarios: Cause-deleted".

**Steps**

1. Click the box beside either "Life Expectancy (Summary)" under the "Calculation" drop down.

2. Check the button beside: "Cause-deleted" under the "Scenario" drop down.

3. Check the box beside the health behaviour that you want to have a cause-deleted calculation.

Multiple health behaviours can be selected for a single calculation. 


##Calculate results

1. Name your calculation in the text box: Calculation name. 
  - Be specific when naming the calculation as it will make it easier to distinguish after running multiple calculations.

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** the larger the data set is the longer the calculations will take. Depending on the size of the data set and the type of calculation being preformed it could take an hour or more. 
</div>


##Visualize Data

*TBD: Need plots on the platform to work through the steps below*
