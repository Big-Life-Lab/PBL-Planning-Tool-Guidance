# Contributing to the documentation

This outlines how provide suggestions or  propose a change to the documentation. 

## Filing an issue

The easiest way to propose a change or new feature is to file an issue. 

If you've found a bug in the code examples, you may also create an associated issue. If possible, try to illustrate your proposal or the bug with a minimal [reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

## Pull request

Feel free to make suggested changes directly in the documentation code using a pull request (PR)
*  Please create a Git branch for each PR.
*  For R code, you should roughly follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org). _Exceptions_ from this guide: function names in PascalCase (e.g. NewFunction()) and variable names as camelCase (e.g newVariable <- "hi").

[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html),
