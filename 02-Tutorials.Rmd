#Getting Started

To help you get started quickly with Project Big Life's Planning Tool, we built a Tutorial directly onto the platform.

The tutorial takes you through step-by-step how to use Project Big Life's Planning Tool. The tutorial will not explain the steps in detail (Chapter \@ref(howto)) nor will it provide reference material (Chapter \@ref(glossary)), but it will give you an understanding of how easy it is to use the Planning Tool! 

**To access the tutorial**, go onto Project Big Life's Planning Tool (http://policy.projectbiglife.ca/) and click on the Tutorial button in the top right corner!
