# Mortality Population Risk Tool (MPoRT) {#mport}

\***Outcomes: Life Expectancy, Number of deaths, 5-year mortality risk**

**Calculations**

Using MPoRT you are able to calculate:

-   For each individual (By row)

    -   5 year mortality risk
    -   Life Expectancy

-   For the population (Summary)

    -   Number of deaths
    -   Life Expectancy
    -   Health behaviour-deleted life expectancy
    -   Health behaviour-deleted number of deaths
    -   Health behaviour attributable life expectancy
    -   Health behaviour attributable number of deaths

**Types of Questions**

-   What is the burden of smoking on life expectancy?
-   How many deaths would be prevented if everyone met their daily exercise requirements?

**Description**

A multivariable predictive risk model that estimates the future risk of all-cause death in Canada. It adjusts for health behaviours: smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, poor diet, and physical inactivity, and a wide range of other risk factors.

## Data requirements for MPoRT

In order to use the MPoRT algorithm on the Project Big Life Tool your data set **must include** the following CCHS 2013/2014 variables:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

(reqVariableMPoRT <- data.frame(
    PUMF_CCHS_variable = c("DDH_SEX", "DHHGAGE*", "WTS_M*"),
    Shared_CCHS_variable = c("DDH_SEX", "DHH_AGE*", "WTS_S*"),
    Description = c("Sex", "Age", "Survey weight") ) 
    )#closingbracket 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Creating the table
kable(reqVariableMPoRT) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = T) %>%
  footnote(symbol = c("Variable names are different between the two files"), footnote_as_chunk = TRUE)
```

In addition the following variables **should** be included to increase the prediction accuracy:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

(recVariableMPoRT <- data.frame(
    PUMF_CCHS_variable = c("ALWDWKY", "CCC_071", "CCC_091", "CCC_101", "CCC_121", "CCC_131", "CCC_151", "CCC_280", "EDUDR04", "FVCDCAR", "FVCDFRU", "FVCDJUI", "FVCDPOT", "FVCDSAL", "FVCDVEG", "HWTGBMI*", "PACDEE", "SDCFIMM", "SDCGCGT*", "SDCGRES*", "SMK_01A", "SMK_05B", "SMK_05C", "SMK_09A", "SMK_204", "SMK_208", "SMKDSTY", "SMKG01C*", "SMKG09C*", "SMKG203*"),

## Descriptions of MPoRT versions

Versions of MPoRT have been developed since 2012 and used in various studies. Each version of MPoRT (v1.0, v1.2, v2.0) used the Ontario subset of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) for development and the survey respondents were linked to personal death records. In later versions of MPoRT (v1.2, v2.0) the following changes were made:, (a) algorithm variables were adjusted to improve predictions, and (b) the algorithms were validated using: the Ontario subset of CCHS of the years that were not used in development and the National CCHS data set (excluding Ontario).

**MPoRTv1.0**

Was used in the [Seven More Years](https://www.ices.on.ca/Publications/Atlases-and-Reports/2012/Seven-More-Years) report, a joint report with Public Health Ontario and ICES . In summary, the algorithm estimated the risk of death associated with health behaviours: smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, poor diet, physical inactivity and stress. There were approximately 550,000 person-years of follow up and over 6000 deaths in the development data set. The algorithm used categorical predictor variables for health behaviours and sociodemographic factors.

**MPoRTv1.2**

Was published in [PLoS](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002082). In summary, the algorithm estimated the risk of death associated with health behaviours: smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, poor diet, and physical inactivity (stress was removed due to its low prediction ability). There were approximately 1 million person-years of follow up and over 9000 deaths in the development and validation data sets. The algorithm used multiple continuous predictor variables, and added chronic disease predictor variables and interaction terms.

**MPoRTv2.0 - Version in Project Big Life's Planning Tool**

This version of MPoRT has not yet been published.

*Development*: This predictive risk model was developed using Ontario subsets of the 2001 to 2008 CCHS and participants were linked to personal health records. There were approximately 1.3 million person-years of follow-up and over 15,000 deaths in the developmental data set.

*Validation*: This predictive risk model was validated using three different data sets: Ontario subset of the 2009 to 2012 CCHS, National data set (except Ontario) of the 2003 to 2008 CCHS, and the National data set of the 2000 and 2005 National Health Interview Survey in the United States of America. In all validation data sets individuals were linked to personal health records.

*Model*: Two MPoRTs have been created: one for males and one for females. Each model is a cox-proportional hazard model that looks similar to:

$$ \text{Mortality risk} = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$

Where:

-   $t$ = survival time
-   $h_0(t)$ = the baseline hazard
-   $\beta_{pred}$ = predictive hazard ratios for the exposures
-   $x$ = the exposure. The exposure can be continuous (e.g. age) or categorical (e.g. smoking status).

*Parameters*: The parameters used in this multivariable predictive risk model are:

```

### Derived parameters

In MPoRTv2 parameters that are derived from variables within the data set include: pack-years of smoking, and the simplified diet score.

**Pack-years of smoking**

Pack-years of smoking is generated from: the type of smoker, age in which they started smoking daily, how many cigarettes they smoke daily, and if applicable the age in which they stopped smoking daily. Pack-years of smoking also includes: their age, the age of their first cigarette, and whether throughout their life they have smoked 100+ cigarettes.

In summary, the more an individual smokes or the longer they smoke, the greater the pack-years of smoking.

**Simplified Diet Score**

The simplified diet score essentially adds the healthy diet variables together (daily servings of carrots, fruit, salad, vegetables) and subtracts the unhealthy diet variables (daily servings of juice and potato).

# Health behaviour attributable calculations

Here we will explain the details behind Project Big Life Planning Tool health behaviour attributable scenarios including: the calculations and additional considerations.

## Calculation

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ysX3M0cMSXQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>

</iframe>

There are two parts to the calculations preformed in health behaviour attributable scenarios: (A) calculate the risk, and (B) calculate the health outcome: life expectancy or number of deaths.

### Part A: Risk calculations

The original multivariable predictive risk algorithm is:

$$ \text{Risk} = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$

**Step 1.** Modify the original algorithm to include the external coefficient(s). This means replacing all predictive hazard ratios/betas related to the health behaviour to the causal hazard ratios/betas.

-   Remove the original regression coefficient(s) for the health behaviour.
-   Add the new external coefficient(s) to the algorithm. External coefficients are generated from either: causal models, or from systematic reviews or meta-analysis.

$$ \text{External coefficient risk} = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{{\beta_\textbf{causal.smoking}}*x_{smoking} + {{\beta_\textbf{causal.cancer}}}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$

**Step 2.** Risk is calculated using the modified algorithm created in Step 1 and the respondent's original profile (e.g. current smoker). This is the "external coefficient risk".

$$ \text{External coefficient risk} = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\beta_{causal.smoking}* {(\textbf{current smoker})} + \beta_{causal.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$

**Step 3.** "Health behaviour-deleted risk' " is calculated by setting an exposure to a reference (non-exposed) value (all other risk exposures remain unchanged).

$$ \text{Health behaviour-deleted risk' } = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\beta_{causal.smoking}* {(\textbf{never smoker})} + \beta_{causal.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$

**Step 4.** The "health behaviour attributable risk external" is calculated as "external coefficient risk" (Step 2) minus the "health behaviour-deleted risk'. "(Step 3).

$$\text{Health behaviour attributable risk}_{external} = \text{External coefficient risk} - \text{Health behaviour-deleted risk'}$$

**Step 5.** Original risk is calculated using the original algorithm and the original respondent's profile.

$$ \text{Original risk} = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{{\beta_\textbf{pred.smoking}}*{(\textbf{current smoker})}+{\beta_\textbf{pred.cancer}}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$

**Step 6.** The "health behaviour-deleted risk external" is calculated by "original risk" (Step 5) minus the "health behaviour-deleted effect external" (Step 4).

$$\text{Health behaviour-deleted risk}_{ external} = \text{Original risk} - \text{Health behaviour attributable risk}_{external}$$

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap= "Risk portion of the health behaviour attribution calculations"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Method2 only -cbf.jpg")
```

### Part B: Health outcome calculations

Using risks generated above you can then calculate:

-   Health behaviour-deleted life expectancy or health behaviour attributable life expectancy lost
-   Health behaviour-deleted number of deaths or health behaviour attributable number of deaths

**Life expectancy calculations**

Step I: Calculate the original life expectancy by using the original risk (Step 5 above) in the sex-specific 5-year abridge period life tables.

Step II: Calculate the health behaviour-deleted life expectancy by using the health behaviour-deleted risk external (Step 6 above) in the sex-specific 5-year abridge period life tables.

Step III: Calculate the health behaviour attributable life expectancy lost by: original life expectancy (Step I) minus health behaviour-deleted life expectancy (Step II):

$$ \text{Health behaviour attributable life exectancy lost} = \text{Health behaviour-deleted life expectancy} - \text{Original life expectancy}$$

**Number of deaths calculations**

Step I: Calculate the number of deaths that would occur using the original risk (Step 5 above).

Step II: Calculate the number of deaths that would occur using the health behaviour-deleted risk external (Step 6 above).

Step III: Calculate the health behaviour attributable deaths by: original number of deaths (Step I) minus health behaviour-deleted number of deaths (Step II):

$$\text{Health behaviour attributable deaths} = \text{Original number of deaths} - \text{Health behaviour-deleted number of deaths}$$

## Additional considerations

### Health behaviours with non-monotonic relationships

Health behaviours with relationships that are non-monotonic (always increasing or always decreasing) can be used in health behaviour attributable calculations but special consideration may be warranted for both policy and analytic reasons.

An example of a health behaviour with a non-monotonic relationship is alcohol. Some studies suggest that there is a "J" shaped risk relationship for outcomes such as cardiovascular disease.

*Is this still a consideration if we are using 0 as the reference value?* *Need to complete the thought at the end of the paragraph* Alcohol drinking guidelines usually do not recommend people: non-drinkers or former-drinkers, initiate drinking. In this situation, the target population for health behaviour attribution calculations can be restricted to for respondents with moderate or higher drinking, or multiple reference exposures could be created.

### Health behaviours with interactions or multiple coefficients

The health behaviour attributable risk and the health behaviour-deleted risk estimates can be calculated for health behaviours with interaction terms, including complex interactions or multiple coefficients. Examples include:

-   health behaviour parameters with age interaction;
-   spline functions with terms for each knot point; or,
-   composite risks such as smoking which may coefficients for smoking status (current, former, never) and pack-years.

All coefficients that related to a common risk factor should be simultaneously considered.

### Exposures not in the original algorithm

# Scenario Object

A key ingredient required to run a scenario is what we call a **scenario object**. A scenario object is a JSON object that tells the engine how to run a scenario. Although there is a lot going on underneath the hood when running a scenario, the 3 main steps are outlined below: 1. Does the individual meet the inclusion criteria for the scenario? This is decided by the `targetPop` field. 2. Update the scenario variable using the method outlined in the `method` field. 3. Check the updated variable value using the `postScenarioRange` field.

The `method` field decides how the variable(s) involved in a certain scenario are manipulated. The methods we currently offer are described below:

1.  [Simple Methods](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/pbl-calculator-engine/wiki/Scenario-Simple-Methods): These are methods that involve simple changes to a variable. Such as changing it to a new value, updating it by a percentage or an absolute value.
2.  [Categorical Methods](here): These are methods that involve changes to the prevalence of a risk factor and can be used only with categorical variables. For eg. Changing the prevalence of smoking in a population.
3.  [Component Methods](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/pbl-calculator-engine/wiki/Scenario-Component-Methods): These are methods that involve changes to a variable based on the value of another variable. For eg. Changing the amount of vegetables a person eats based on their total fruit and vegetable consumption.

### Example: How would the life expectancy of a population change if they all started following the "Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines"?

The JSON object below implements the question described above. Don't worry if it does not make sense, we will be explaining the various fields that go into the object in other sections.

    {

        "scenarios": [

                        }
                    ]
                },

                    "variables": [
                        {
                            "variableName": "PACDEE",
                            "method": "attribution",
                            "targetPop": [0, 2.1],
                            "postScenarioRange": [2.1, null]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
    }

## Next Steps

Go over [this](TODO) page that describes the general structure of a scenario object as well as the fields common from one object to another.

## Editing Scenario Simple Methods

Use the methods in this section for simple manipulation of scenario variables like updating them to a new value, updating them by a percentage etc.

There are 3 types of simple methods: 1. Attribution 2. Relative 3. Absolute

We will consider scenarios involving individuals who do not meet the "Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines", seeing how each of the above methods changes an individuals's physical activity. The guidelines state that an adult should do 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity in a day which roughly translates to a minimum of 3 "metabolic equivalent of task" (METs) a day. We'll the use the name "PhysicalActivity\_cont" to represent the variable for the number of METs completed in a day.

We will be running each scenario through the following 2 individuals: 1. One who meets the guidelines (PhysicalActivity\_cont \>= 3) 2. One who does not meet the guidelines (PhysicalActivity\_cont \< 3) And see how their profile changes with each method

## Attribution

Use this method when the scenario variable needs to be updated to a new value. Consider the scenario object below:

    {
        "variableName": "PhysicalActivity_cont", // This is the variable we want to change
        "method": "attribution", // The method type
        "targetPop": [null, 3], // Only run the scenario on individuals who do not meet the guidelines
        "scenarioValue": 3 // What the value of the variable should be i.e. bring them up to the recommended level
    }

The aim of the above object is to bring people who do not meet the guidelines up to the recommended level i.e. 3 METs.

Looking at our 2 example individuals: 1. With a `targetPop` field value of `[null, 3]`, this individual would not meet the inclusion criteria for this scenario, thus his profile would not be changed by it 2. This individual does meet the inclusion criteria and his new value for the `PhysicalActivity_cont` variable would be 3

## Relative

Use this method when the scenario variable needs to be increased or decreased by a percentage value. Consider the scenario object below:

    {
        "variableName": "PhysicalActivity_cont", // This is the variable we want to change
        "method": "relative", // The method type
        "targetPop": [null, 3], // Only run the scenario on individuals who do not meet the guidelines
        "scenarioValue": 10 // Increase the variable's value by 10%
    }

The aim of this object is to increase the physical activity value for individuals by 10%, but only if they do not meet the guidelines defined in the `targetPop` field.

Looking at our 2 individuals once again, nothing would happen to individual 1. However for individual 2, the way the scenario is applied would change due to our new relative method. Now rather than the `PhysicalActivity_cont` variable being set to 3, it would increase by 10%. For eg., if the current value was 1.5 METs, after going through the scenario it would be 1.65 METs.

## Absolute

Similar to the relative method, an absolute method changes the scenario variable by increasing or decreasing it by the value provided in the `scenarioVariable` field. Take a look at the scenario object below:

    {
        "variableName": "PhysicalActivity_cont", // This is the variable we want to change
        "method": "absolute", // The method type
        "targetPop": [null, 3], // Only run the scenario on individuals who do not meet the guidelines
        "scenarioValue": 10 // Increase the variable's value by 10 METs
    }

Here we want to increase the number of METs by 10 if the individual does not meet the Canadian guidelines.

Once again for our 2 individuals, this scenario would only affect individual 2 by increasing their METs value by 10. Thus if they had a value of 5 METs, it would be 15 after the scenario.

## Scenario Component Methods

Component methods can be used when the new value of an intervention variable is calculated by first modifying another related variable and using it's relationship to the intervention variable to calculate it's new value.

E.g., An intervention on the total number of vegetables that an individual consumes in a day (Veg\_cont) by first changing the total number of fruits and vegetables that they consume in a day (TotalFruitVeg\_cont). In the above example,\
**Veg\_cont** is the intervention variable\
**TotalFruitVeg\_cont** is the related variable

The relation between the variables is described by the formula below:\
TotalFruitVeg\_cont = Veg\_cont + Fruit\_cont\
where **Fruit\_cont** is the total number of fruits eaten in a day

There are 3 types of component methods: 1. Component Attribution 2. Component Relative 3. Component Absolute

We will explain each of them by using the diet example above.

## Component Attribution

Use this method when the related variable has to be updated to a new value. E.g., if we wanted all the individuals in our scenario to consume 5 total fruits and vegetables in a day (TotalFruitVeg\_cont = 5) by only updating the number of vegetables they eat. The scenario object would look like,

``` {.jsonc}
{
    "variableName": "Veg_cont", // This is the variable we want to change
    "method": "component attribution", // The method type
    "targetPop": [ 
        {
            "variableName": "TotalFruitVeg_cont",
            "range": [null, 5]
        }
     ], // Only change an individual if they are below or at 5 total fruit and vegetables in a day
     "parentVariable": "TotalFruitVeg", // The related variable
     "scenarioValue": 5 // What the value of the related variable should be 
}
```

Let's look at how the scenario object would work with the 2 individuals below: 1. An individual who eats 3 vegetables and 7 fruits per day 2. An individual who eats 3 vegetables and 1 fruit per day

For the first individual, the value of TotalFruitVeg\_cont would be 10, which does not meet the inclusion criteria for this scenario which is that the TotalFruitVeg\_cont value should be less than or equal to 5.

For the second individual, the value of TotalFruitVeg\_cont would be 4 which meets the inclusion criteria for the scenario. We know that the target value of TotalFruitVeg\_cont is 5, which is 1 more than what this individual has. So the new value of Veg\_cont will be 4, bringing the TotalFruitVeg\_cont value up to 5.

## Component Relative

Use this method when the intervention variable is updated by first updating the related variable by a percentage defined in the scenario object.

``` {.jsonc}
{
    "variableName": "Veg_cont", // This is the variable we want to change
    "method": "component relative", // The method type
    "targetPop": [ 
        {
            "variableName": "TotalFruitVeg_cont",
            "range": [null, 7]
        }
     ], // Only change an individual if they are below or at 7 total fruit and vegetables in a day
     "parentVariable": "TotalFruitVeg_cont", // The related variable
     "scenarioValue": 15 // Update their total fruits and vegetables count by 15%
}
```

Here the **scenarioValue** describes a percentage which can be negative or positive. Let's once again look at how the scenario would be run with the individuals in the component attribution scenario.

For the first individual, once again they would not be included in the scenario since they do not meet the inclusion criteria.

For the second individual, their TotalFruitVeg\_cont value is 6 which does meet the inclusion criteria. So we would increase this value by 15% which would bring it up to 6.9 leading to an increase in the intervention variable (Veg\_cont) of 0.9 to make up this difference.

## Component Absolute

Use this method when the intervention variable is updated by first updating the related variable by a value defined in the scenario object.

``` {.jsonc}
{
    "variableName": "Veg_cont", // This is the variable we want to change
    "method": "component absolute", // The method type
    "targetPop": [ 
        {
            "variableName": "TotalFruitVeg_cont",
            "range": [null, 7]
        }
     ], // Only change an individual if they are below or at 7 total fruit and vegetables in a day
     "parentVariable": "TotalFruitVeg_cont", // The related variable
     "scenarioValue": 5 // Update the TotalFruitVeg_cont value by 5
}
```

Here the **scenarioValue** describes a number which can be negative or positive. Looking at our individuals again,

For the first individual, once again they would not be included in the scenario since they do not meet the inclusion criteria.

For the second individual, their TotalFruitVeg\_cont value is 6 which does meet the inclusion criteria. So we would increase this value by 5 which would bring it up to 11 leading to an increase in the intervention variable (Veg\_cont) of 5 to make up this difference.

## Things to Note

1.  The relationship between the intervention and related variable should be linear of the form,\
    y = x + m*v + n*z + .... <br /> where **x** is the intervention variable, **y** is the related variable, **v, z** are other variables and **m, n** are constants. Notice how the there is no intercept in the equation and no constant term in front of the intervention variable.
2.  The **scenarioValue** field describes how the **parentVariable** should be changes, which in turn affects the intervention variable described by the variableName field.
