## Customize Data

<div class="FOO">
<!-- **Note:** The Project Big Life Planning Tool can only be used with the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) in '.csv' format.  -->
```{r}

```

Other years of CCHS can be used but only if the required variables are transformed to the 2013/2014 CCHS format.
</div>



Prior to using the Project Big Life Planning Tool you may want to transform your data set. Reasons include: customized filter(s) and/or customized stratification(s), or transforming variables from other population health surveys to the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) format. Any variable that you create can be selected within the planning tool in the filter and/or stratify options.

Data manipulation can occur on any programming software: R, SAS, STATA, etc, as long as you output your data set as a '.csv' file.

### Customize filter and/or stratification

An example of customizing your data set is converting the variable: Body Mass Index (CCHS 2013/2014 variable HWTGBMI) from a continuous variable into four distinct categories:

- Underweight: BMI less then 18.5
- Normal or Healthy Weight: BMI of 18.5 to 24.9
- Overweight: BMI of 25.0 to 29.9
- Obese: BMI greater or equal to 30.0

**Steps**

The following steps show the R code that would be used to create these strata:

1. Convert observations "Not stated" from 999.99 to NA
```
    data[data == 999.99] <- NA
```
2. Load the R package dpylr. This package is used for data manipulation.
```
    library(dpylr)
```
3. Create a new column that contains four categories for BMI
```
    data$newcolumn <- cut(data$HWTGBMI, breaks = c(0,18.5,25,30,Inf),  labels=c("Underweight", "Healthy", "Overweight", "Obese")
```
4. The output will be your data set + a new column with the corresponding category ("Underweight", "Healthy", "Overweight", "Obese") for that individual.

```
    HWTGBMI   newcolumn
  1   22.68     Healthy
  2   26.99  Overweight
  3      NA        <NA>
  4   34.44       Obese
  5   23.77     Healthy
  6   17.23 Underweight
```

This new column can be now be used with the Project Big Life Planning Tool for the purpose of filtering or stratification.

###Transforming variables to 2013/2014 CCHS format

Population health surveys other then the 2013/2014 CCHS PUMF can be used if the variables: sex, age and survey weight (required variables) are transformed to the 2013/2014 CCHS format.

For example the 2005/2006 CCHS data can be used if the 2005/2006 CCHS variable for age is renamed from DHH**E**GAGE to and DHHGAGE (2013/2014 format). Although the name for the variable name for age is different between the 2005/2006 and 2013/2014 surveys, they capture identical information.


```{}
library(dpylr)

CCHSdata.2005.2006 <- CCHSdata.2005.2006 %>%
  rename(DHHGAGE = DHHEGAGE)
```

All required variables **must** be transformed to the 2013/2014 CCHS format. It is also recommended that you transform the recommend variables as well to increase the accuracy of the prediction(s).

When transforming required or recommended variables pay attention to how the data was captured. There may be differences limit the ability to use the data set or differences that will affect your results. For instance from the 2001-2004 CCHS survey age is captured in 15 categories but from 2005-2013 age is captured in 16 categories.


## Load data

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** The Project Big Life Planning Tool can only be used with the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) in '.csv' format.

Other years of CCHS can be used but only if the required variables are transformed to the 2013/2014 CCHS variable format.
</div>

Only **one data file** can be used on the planning tool at a time; the planning tool cannot preform a calculation across multiple data files. If you wish to use data from different data sets, you first merge the data sets together and use the 2013/2014 CCHS format (e.g. variable names). Once data sets are merged into one data file you can load your data on to the Planning Tool.

There are two options of data files: a sample file or your own file.


### Load sample files

If you don't have your own data or want to explore the platform's capabilities before using your data, you can use the sample file on the Project Big Life Planning Tool. There are three sample files included on the planning tool:

There are three sample files:

- CCHS-2013-1-percent
- CCHS-2013-10-percent
- CCHS-2013-100-percent

Each sample file is from the 2013/2014 CCHS PUMF datafile and contains: 1%, 10% or 100% of the respondents. Each sample file contains all the variables (survey questions) from the 2013/2014 CCHS survey.

**Steps**

1. Click 'Select' beside the "Sample file" to select it.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Datafiles.jpg")
```

### Load your own file

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** Data you load to the Project Big Life Planning Tool remains on your computer and is not uploaded or sent anywhere.
</div>

If you want to use your own file, that file must use the 2013/2014 CCHS variable names and:

- **Must include all** the **required** variables: DDH_SEX (sex), DHHGAGE (age), and WTS_M (survey weight).

- **Should include** some or all of the **recommended** variables. Recommended variables aren't required for calculations but will increase the accuracy of the predicted health outcome.

More information on the required and recommended variables can be found [Appendix](#mport).


**Steps**

1. Click the **Load file** button under "Select a file to use in calculations".

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Datafiles-Load.jpg")
```

2. Locate the file on your computer, select, and open.

3. Choose the file type: PUMF CCHS 2013/2014 PUMF for your uploaded file, in the table that showcases all of the files.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Datafiles-Load-Filetype.jpg")
```


Note:

- If the loaded file has all of the variables required and recommended for calculation, you will be able to 'Select' the file and continue with the planning tool.

- If the loaded file does **not** have all the variables **required** for the calculation you will not be able to continue with the planning tool.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Datafiles-Load-Error.jpg")
```

- If the loaded file does **not** have all the variables **recommended** for calculation you will be able to 'Select' the file and continue with the planning tool, however the calculations may be less accurate.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Datafiles-Load-Warning.jpg")
```

## Select calculation

There are two general types of calculations: summary measures and by row measures.

- **Summary measures:** (ref:Summarycalc)

- **By row measures:** (ref:byrowcalc)

Summary measures must be selected for calculations that have stratifications or scenarios (both intervention and  health behaviour attribution).

More details of what the calculations are and how they are preformed can be found in [key concepts](#keyconcepts) - "Calculations".

**Steps**

1. Click '+ Create'

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Create.jpg")
```

2. Name your calculation.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/CalcName.jpg")
```

3. Check the box beside the calculation's name under "Calculations" to select it. A single calculation or multiple calculations may be selected.

- Once selected, the types(s) of the calculations will appear to the right of "Calculations".

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/SelectCalc.jpg")
```



## Filter data

Use filters when you want to analyze only a subset of your data.

**Steps**

1. Click on the toggle button beside "Filters".

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Filter.jpg")
```

2. Click **+ New** under the Filter bar.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/FilterSelect.jpg")
```

3. Select the variable that you want to filter on by typing its variable name into the "search variables" text bar.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/FilterSearch.jpg")
```


4. Filter **in** the categories/levels within the variable by:

  - **Categorical:** Clicking on the "Search categories"" text bar. Scroll and select the category you want to **keep** in your data. Repeat this step to add additional categories.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/FilterCat.jpg")
```

  - **Continous:** Click the "cycle button" found under the variable you have selected. Two new boxes will appear.
    - Select the minimum value for your subset data in the box on the left by typin the value.
    - Select the maximum value for your subset data in the box on your right by typing the value.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/FilterCont.jpg")
```


4. To add another filter repeat the steps above. A maximum of three filters are recommended to maintain statistical power (added filters reduce sample sizes and reduces statistical power).

  - Once selected, the name(s) of the filtered variable(s) will appear to the right of "Filters".

You are able to filter on all types of variables: required for calculation, recommended for calculation, and all other variables.


### Remove a filter

- To remove a filter entirely, click on the trash can beside the variable you want to delete.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/FilterRemove1.jpg")
```

- To remove a level within a filtered variable - categorical, click on the 'x' beside the variable level.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/FilterRemove2.jpg")
```

## Stratify data

Use stratifications when you want to get a result for multiple strata (levels or classes).

A summary measure must be selected for stratifications, as only a summary measure will be outputted for each strata. By row measurements may also be selected but they will not be stratified.

**Steps**

1. Click the toggle button beside "Stratifications".

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Strat.jpg")
```

2. Select the variables you want to stratify on under the "Stratifications'. You are only able to stratify on categorical variables.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/StratSelect.jpg")
```

3. To add another variable for stratification repeat the steps above. A maximum of 3 stratifications are recommended to maintain statistical power (added strata reduce strata sample size and reduces statistical power).

- Once selected, the name(s) of the stratified variable(s) will appear to the right of "Stratifications".

You are able to stratify on all types of categorical variables: required for calculation, recommended for calculation, and other variables (includes customized variables).

### Remove a stratification

- To remove a stratification variable click on the 'x' beside the variable level.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/StratRemove.jpg")
```


## Run scenarios

Scenarios can be used to predict the health outcomes when unhealthy behaviours:

- are modified in the population: **Intervention**, or
- were never present in the population: **health behaviour attribution**

Scenarios can be used to inform potential health policies or programs.

### Intervention scenarios

Interventions provide you with the ability to customize the scenarios. For example you can answer the questions:

- what if we only had 15% of the population smoked rather then the current 20%?
- what if everyone increased their physical activity by 10%?
- what if everyone ate 4 fruit and vegetable servings each day?
- what if everyone drank 2 fewer drinks per week?

These intervention scenarios allow you to predict and compare the effectiveness of policies.

There are 3 types of intervention scenarios that you can select:

- **Absolute:** each individual in the population **changes** their health behaviour **by a value of x**.
- **Relative:** each individual in the population **changes** their health behaviour **by a ratio of y**.
- **Target:** each individual in the population **has a set value of z.**

More information on the specifics of each type of intervention scenario and how they are calculated can be found in [key concepts](#keyconcepts) - "Scenarios: Interventions".

**Steps**

1. Click the toggle button beside "Scenario"

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Scenario.jpg")
```

2. Select "Intervention" from the "Scenario Type" menu.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Scenario-Intervention.jpg")
```

3. Select the "Type" of intervention you want beside your target health behaviour.

- A description of each intervention scenario and how they are calculated can be found in [key concepts](#keyconcepts) - "Scenarios: Interventions"

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Scenario-Intervention-Abs.jpg")
```

4. Type or use the arrow keys to get the value you want.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Scenario-Intervention-Abs2.jpg")
```

Multiple health behaviour interventions can be selected for a single calculation.



### Health behaviour attribution scenarios

Health behaviour attribution scenarios provide you with the best case scenario for the population. For example:

- what if no one in the population ever smoked?
- what if everyone in the population met their recommended physical activity levels (3.00 METs/week)?

More information on health behaviour attribution calculations and how they are calculated can be found in key concepts](#keyconcepts) - "Scenarios: Health behaviour attribution".

**Steps**

1. Click the toggle button beside "Scenario"

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Scenario.jpg")
```

2. Select "Intervention" from the "Scenario Type" menu.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Scenario-HBattribution.jpg")
```

3. Check the box beside the intervention you want to do.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Scenario-HBattribution2.jpg")
```

Multiple health behaviours can be selected for a single calculation.


## Run calculation

**Steps**

Click "Calculate" in the bottom right corner once you have selected your conditions.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Calculate.jpg")
```

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** the larger the data set is the longer the calculations will take. Depending on the size of the data set and the type of calculation being preformed it could take an hour or more.
</div>

2. A new table will appear under the calculations box. The table includes the status of the calculation, calculation name and the selected conditions: measures, filters, stratifications, and scenarios.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Calculate2.jpg")
```

3. A "View" button will appear next to your calculation once it is complete.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Calculate3.jpg")
```



## View results

1. Click the "View" button beside the calculation you want to see.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Calculate3.jpg")
```

2. The Results Box appears at the bottom of the web page.

The following tabs will **always** appear:

- **Overview:** gives a summary of the calculation(s).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Results-Overview.jpg")
```

- **Log:** gives a summary of the warnings and errors that happened during the calculation.

The following tabs will appear based on your calculation:

- **By Row Measures** will give you a table with the 'by row measure' average.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Results-ByRow.jpg")
```

- **Summary Measures** will give you a table with summary measures. This tab will only appear when **no** stratifications are selected.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Results-Summary.jpg")
```

- **Stratifications** will give you a graph with the summary measures, when stratifications are selected.

## Resolve warning or error messages

There are different types of warning and error messages that may appear.

Below describes some of the messages that are likely to occur and steps to resolve them.

### Invalid category

The value for a variable in the row is not one of the recognized category values.

You can click the **View variables** button to see all recognized category values.

### Out of range

The value for a variable in the row is outside of the recognized range of values.

You can click the **View variables** button to see all recognized value ranges.

### Not a number

The value for a variable in the row is not a number, and can't be processed.

### Sample size is too small

A small sample size could be the result of one or more of the following:

* The input file has a small sample size
* The filters that were applied reduced the number of rows significantly
* The calculation is being stratified, and one or more of the groupings has a small sample size
* There were a significant number of rows with errors

Rows with one or more errors won't be processed, and won't be included in the sample size. Rows with no errors will be processed and included in the sample size, even if they have multiple warnings.
