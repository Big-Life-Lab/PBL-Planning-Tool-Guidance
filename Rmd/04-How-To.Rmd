##Customize Data

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** The Project Big Life Planning Tool can only be used with the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) or Shared versions in '.csv' format. 

Other population health surveys can be used only if the required variables are transformed to the specifications of the 2013/2014 CCHS data. Please note that the Project Big Life team is in the process of supporting CCHS versions from 2001 to 2013. 
</div>

Prior to using the Project Big Life Planning Tool you may want to transform your data set. Reasons include: customized filter(s) and/or customized stratification(s), and transforming variables from other population health surveys to the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) format. Any variable that you create can be selected within the planning tool in the filter and/or stratify options.

Data manipulation can occur on any programming software: R, SAS, STATA, etc, as long as you output your data set as a '.csv' file. 

###Customize filter and/or stratification

An example of customizing your data set is converting the variable: Body Mass Index (CCHS 2013 variable HWTGBMI) from a continuous variable into four distinct categories:
    
- Underweight: BMI less then 18.5
- Normal or Healthy Weight: BMI of 18.5 to 24.9
- Overweight: BMI of 25.0 to 29.9
- Obese: BMI greater or equal to 30.0

**Steps**

The following steps show the R code that would be used to create these strata:

1. Convert observations "Not stated" from 999.99 to NA
```    
    data[data == 999.99] <- NA
```      
2. Load the R package dpylr. This package is used for data manipulation.
```
    library(dpylr)
```       
3. Create a new column that contains four categories for BMI
``` 
    data$newcolumn <- cut(data$HWTGBMI, breaks = c(0,18.5,25,30,Inf),  labels=c("Underweight", "Healthy", "Overweight", "Obese")
``` 
4. The output will be your data set + a new column with the corresponding category ("Underweight", "Healthy", "Overweight", "Obese") for that individual.

```
    HWTGBMI   newcolumn
  1   22.68     Healthy
  2   26.99  Overweight
  3      NA        <NA>
  4   34.44       Obese
  5   23.77     Healthy
  6   17.23 Underweight
```

This new column can be now be used with the Project Big Life Planning Tool for the purpose of filtering or stratification.

###Transforming variables to 2013/2014 CCHS format

Population health surveys other then the 2013/2014 CCHS PUMF or Shared files can be used if the variables: sex, age and survey weight (required variables) are transformed to the 2013/2014 CCHS format. 

For example the 2005/2006 CCHS data the age variable is titled DHH**E**GAGE and in the 2013/2014 CCHS data it is DHHGAGE. Although the variable's name changes the data is captured identically in the 2005/2006 and 2013/2014 surveys. Therefore you can use the 2005/2006 CCHS data if you transform this variable to the 2013/2014 format. 

```{}
library(dpylr)

CCHSdata.2005.2006 <- CCHSdata.2005.2006 %>% 
  rename(DHHGAGE = DHHEGAGE)
```

All required variables **must** be transformed to the 2013/2014 CCHS format. It is also recommended that you transform the recommend variables as well to increase the accuracy of the prediction(s).

When transforming required or recommended variables pay attention to how the variables are captured. There may be differences limit the ability to use the data set or that will affect your results. For instance from the 2001-2004 CCHS survey there are 15 age categories but from 2005-2013 there are 16 age categories. 


##Load data 

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** The Project Big Life Planning Tool can currently only support .csv data files from the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). Both the 2013/2014 CCHS PUMF and Shared file are accepted.
</div>

Data loaded to the Project Big Life Planning Tool:

- **Must include** the **required** variables: DDH_SEX (sex), DHHGAGE (age), and WTS_M (survey weight).

- **Should include** some or all of the **recommended** variables. Recommended variables aren't required for calculations but will increase the accuracy of the predicted health outcome. 

Only **one data file** can be used on the planning tool at a time; the planning tool cannot preform a calculation across multiple data files. If you wish to use data from different data sets, you first merge the data sets together and use the 2013/14 CCHS format (e.g. variable names). Once data sets are merged into one data file you can load your data on to the Planning Tool. 

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** Data you load to the Project Big Life Planning Tool remains on your computer and is not uploaded or sent anywhere.
</div>

There are two options of data files: a sample file or your own file. 


###Load sample files

If you don't have your own data or want to explore the platform's capabilities before using your data, you can use the sample file on the Project Big Life Planning Tool. There is one sample file included on the planning tool:

- **data.sample.csv** this is fabricated data set that includes all variables required for calculation, recommend for calculation, and needed for the case examples (found in Chapter \@ref(caseexamples)). This data set is based on the 2013/2014 CCHS PUMF but it is **entirely fabricated and can only be used for examplary purposes.**

**Steps**

1. Click on the file name under "Sample files" to select it. 


###Load your own file

**Steps**

1. Click the **Browse** button under "Select a file to use in calculations".

2. Locate the file on your computer, select, and open. 

- If the loaded file has all of the variables required and recommended for calculation, you will be able to continue with the planning tool. 
  
- If the loaded file does **not** have all the variables **required** for the calculation you will not be able to continue with the planning tool.
  
- If the loaded file does **not** have all the variables **recommended** for calculation you will be able to continue with the planning tool, however the calculations may be less accurate. 



##Select calculation

There are two general types of calculations: summary measures and by row measures.

- **Summary measures:** (ref:Summarycalc)

- **By row measures:** (ref:byrowcalc)

Summary measures must be selected for calculations that have stratifications, intervention scenarios, and  cause-deleted scenario.

**Steps**

1. Check the box beside the calculation's name under "Calculations" to select it. A single calculation or multiple calculations may be selected.

  - Once selected the name(s) of the calculation(s) will appear to the right of "Calculations".

More details of what the calculations are and how they are preformed can be found in key concepts (Chapter \@ref(keyconcepts)) - "Calculations".


##Filter data

Use filters when you want to analyze only a subset of your data.

**Steps**

1. Click on the **+ New** button under "Filters".

2. Select the variable that you want to filter on by typing its variable name into the "search variables" text bar.

3. Filter **in** the categories/levels within the variable by:

  - **Categorical:** Clicking on the "Search categories"" text bar. Scroll and select the category you want to **keep** in your data. Repeat this step to add additional categories.

  - **Continous:** Click the "cycle button" found under the variable you have selected. Two new boxes will appear. 
    - Select the minimum value for your subset data in the box on the left by typing the values or using the arrows. 
    - Select the maximum value for your subset data in the box on your right by typing the value or using the arrows.
    
4. To add another filter repeat the steps above. A maximum of three filters are recommended to maintain statistical power (added filters reduce sample sizes and reduces statistical power). 

  - Once selected, the name(s) of the filtered variable(s) will appear to the right of "Filters".

You are able to filter on all types of variables: required for calculation, recommended for calculation, and ignore variables (includes customized variables).


###Remove a filter

- To remove a filter entirely, click on the trash can beside the variable you want to delete.

- To remove a level within a filtered variable - categorical, click on the 'x' beside the variable level.


##Stratify data

Use stratifications when you want to get a result for multiple strata (levels or classes). 

A summary measure must be selected for stratifications, as only a summary measure will be outputted for each strata. By row measurements may also be selected but they will not be stratified.

**Steps**

1. Click the box beside either "Life Expectancy (Summary)" or "Deaths (Five Years)" under the "Calculation" drop down.

2. Select the variables you want to stratify on under the "Stratifications'. You are only able to stratify on categorical variables.

3. To add another variable for stratification repeat the steps above. A maximum of 3 stratifications are recommended to maintain statistical power (added strata reduce strata sample size and reduces statistical power).

- Once selected, the name(s) of the stratified variable(s) will appear to the right of "Stratifications".

You are able to stratify on all types of categorical variables: required for calculation, recommended for calculation, and ignore variables (includes customized variables).

###Remove a stratification

- To remove a stratification variable click on the 'x' beside the variable level.



##Run scenarios

Scenarios can be used to predict the health outcomes when unhealthy behaviours:

- are modified in the population: **Intervention**, or
- were never present in the population: **Cause-deleted**

Scenarios can be used to inform potential health policies or programs.

###Intervention scenarios

Interventions provide you with the ability to customize the scenarios. For example you can answer the questions:

- what if we only had 15% of the population smoked rather then the current 20%?
- what if everyone increased their physical activity by 10%?
- what if everyone ate 4 fruit servings each day?
- what if everyone drank 2 fewer drinks per week?

These intervention scenarios allow you to predict and compare the effectiveness of policies.

There are 3 types of intervention scenarios that you can select:

- **Absolute:** each individual in the population **changes** their health behaviour **by a value of x**. 
- **Relative:** each individual in the population **changes** their health behaviour **by a ratio of y**.
- **Target:** each individual in the population **has a set value of z.**

More information on the specifics of each type of intervention scenario and how they are calculated can be found in Key Concepts (Chapter \@ref(keyconcepts)) - "Scenarios: Interventions".

**Steps**

1. Click the box beside either "Life Expectancy (Summary)" under the "Calculation" drop down.

2. Check the button beside: "Intervention" under the "Scenario" drop down.

3. Click on the health behaviour you want to modify: e.g. Diet.

- A drop down menu of all the possible variables of that health behaviour you can modify will appear.

4. Click the box beside the variable you want to modify: e.g. Daily consumption - fruit - (D).

- A drop down menu of the scenario types: absolute, relative, and target, will appear.

5. Check the button beside the type of intervention you want to modify: e.g. Target.

6. Use the arrows beside the the text box: "Decrease by" or "Increase by" to add the value you are modifying: e.g. The value of 4 is used for the scenario what if everyone ate 4 fruit servings each day?

Multiple health behaviours and variables within the health behaviours can be selected for a single calculation.

- Once selected, the name(s) of the health behaviour(s) that have been selected for the intervention will appear to the right of "Scenario".

###Cause-deleted scenarios

Cause-deleted scenarios provide you with the ability to see the best case scenario for the population. For example:

- what if no one in the population ever smoked?
- what if everyone in the population met their recommended physical activity levels (3.00 METs/week)?

More information on cause-deleted calculations and how they are calculated can be found in key concepts (_Chapter \@ref(keyconcepts)_) - "Scenarios: Cause-deleted".

**Steps**

1. Click the box beside either "Life Expectancy (Summary)" under the "Calculation" drop down.

2. Check the button beside: "Cause-deleted" under the "Scenario" drop down.

3. Check the box beside the health behaviour that you want to have a cause-deleted calculation.

Multiple health behaviours can be selected for a single calculation. 


##Calculate results

1. Name your calculation in the text box: Calculation name. 
  - Be specific when naming the calculation as it will make it easier to distinguish after running multiple calculations.

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** the larger the data set is the longer the calculations will take. Depending on the size of the data set and the type of calculation being preformed it could take an hour or more.
