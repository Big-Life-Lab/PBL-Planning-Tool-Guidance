# Background {#background}

The wide range of enhanced surveillance applications is made possible through the tool's multivariable predictive approach. The statistical and machine learning algorithms used by the BPL planning tool are a more complex approach to measure the burden from health behaviours compared to traditional approaches.[@manuel2018] However, the planning tool carries out those complex calculators for you, without the need for statistical software.

Calculations are performed on a population sample of individuals rather than the traditional approach of using aggregated data. The predictive algorithms use the distinct characteristics of each respondent in the database, rather than assuming a person's risk of a health outcome (e.g. death) is the same as other respondents with the same age and sex. 

The algorithms available on the planning tool have been developed and validated using data routinely-collected by Statistics Canada and provincial health agencies. All algorithms have been published in peer-review journals and are [publicly available](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/predictive-algorithms). More information about multivariable predictive risk algorithms can be found in the [key concepts](#keyconcepts) or [appendices](#mport).

The PBL Planning Tool was developed by the [Project Big Life](https://www.projectbiglife.ca) Team based at the [Ottawa Hospital](http://www.ohri.ca/home.asp) and the [Bruy√®re Research Institute](https://www.bruyere.org/en/bruyere-research-institute).

The tool was made in collaboration with [Public Health Ontario](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/), the [Population Health Analytics Lab](https://pophealthanalytics.com/) at the University of Toronto and [Ottawa Public Health](http://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/index.aspx). 

Tool development was supported by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care through the Applied Health Research Question program, administered through [ICES](https://www.ICES.on.ca).

Algorithms used in the planning tool were developed using linked population data housed at [ICES](https://www.ices.on.ca/) and validated at Statistics Canada. All algorithms have been published in peer-review journals.
