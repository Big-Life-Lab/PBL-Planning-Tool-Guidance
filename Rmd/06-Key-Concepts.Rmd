##Data and sample files

<div class="FOO">
The Project Big Life Planning Tool currently accepts **2013/2014 Public Use Microdata File and Shared File of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) in '.csv' format.**
</div>

###What is the Canadian Community Health Survey?

The CCHS is an annual cross-sectional survey preformed by Statistics Canada. The CCHS collects information related to health status, health care utilization, and health determinants for the Canadian population. Data is shared at the the sub-provincial geographic level (health region or combination of health regions).

- Details about the survey and its design can be found on Statistic Canada website  (http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&Id=144170). 
- Details and access to the Public Use Microdata file (PUMF) can be found through the Odesi website (https://search2.odesi.ca/#/details?uri=%2Fodesi%2Fcchs-82M0013-E-2013-2014-Annual-component.xml)

###Why can I only use the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey data?

Each year the CCHS changes a few variables it captures. This makes CCHS data sets from every year other then 2013/2014 incompatible with the algorithms used by the Project Big Life Planning Tool.

The Project Big Life Planning Team is currently working to adjust the algorithms so that they accept other CCHS years, and we will update the guidance when we are done.

###Sample Files

- data.sample.csv this is fabricated data set that includes all variables required for calculation, recommend for calculation, and needed for the real life application examples (found in Chapter 5). It includes all required and recommended variables: age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, diet components, daily physical activity expenditure, chronic conditions, ethnicity, immigration status, and education. 

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** Although the data.sample.csv is based on the 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey Public Use Microdata File from if was created only for example purposes and **cannot** be used for analysis.

##Multivariable predictive risk algorithms

Multivariable predictive risk algorithms predict the future risk of health outcomes (e.g. Life Expectancy) for a population using routinely collected health data.

Multivariable predictive risk algorithms can be used to:

- Project the number of new cases of the health outcome
- Estimate the contribution of specific risk factors of the health outcome
- Evaluate effectiveness of health interventions
- Describe the distribution of risk in the population (diffused or concentrated)

Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are able to assess equity issues compared to competing population risk methods (e.g. World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease).

More information on what multivariable predictive risk algorithms are and how they can be used can be found the journal article: *Predictive risk algorithms in a population setting: an overview* [@PoRTover]

###Development of multivariable predictive risk algorithms

Data:

-	Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are created using routinely collected data that includes information about risk factors (exposure) and health events (outcomes).
-	Data is collected at an individual level through population health surveys (e.g. Canadian Community Health Survey) and administrative databases (e.g. Vital Statistics). Data sources are linked together when the individual has given permission too.
- Individuals are followed overtime until the health event (e.g. death or disease) occurs.
- Separate data is collected to create a derivation cohort and validation cohort(s). 

    - Note: The risk factors that are collected are from population health surveys and are self-reported; no clinical data (e.g. blood pressure) is collected. Risk factors focus on health behaviours (e.g. smoking) and sociodemographic factors, commonly associated with health outcome.

**Algorithm generation:**

- Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are cox proportional hazard models that analyze time to health outcome (e.g. death) *Question for Carol - The models are not cox-porportional hazard models but they are similar?*

- Multivariable predictive risk algorithms are developed and validated in 4 stages:

    - Algorithm derivation: the predictive risk algorithm is created using data from the derivation cohort
    - Algorithm validation: the predictive risk algorithm is applied to the validation cohort
    - Final algorithm generation: validation and derivation cohorts are combined to estimate the final application of the predictive risk algorithm 
    - Derivation of the application algorithm: creation of a parsimonous (fewer predictors) algorithm that maintained discrimination, calibration, and overall algorithm performance
    
- In each stage of the algorithm development and validation, algorithm performance is assessed using measures of discrimination and calibration.

###Multivariable predictive risk algorithms built in Project Big Life Planning Tool

##Calculations

###Summary vs By Row

There are two general types of calculations Summary Measures and By Row Measures.

Summary measures: (ref:Summarycalc)

By row measures: (ref:byrowcalc)

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** Summary Measures are not the same as taking the average of By Row Measures. Summary measures account for the survey weights in their calculations. Only averaging the By Row Measures does not account for the survey weights and will result in an incorrect outcome. 
</div>

###Weighted vs unweighted



##Calculations: specific health outcomes


###Risk of health outcome

Risk of the health outcome (e.g. risk of dying) is the outcome of a multivariable predictive risk algorithm. An example of the mutlivariable risk algorithm is:

$$ \text{Risk} = \sum_t h_0(t) * e^{\beta_{pred.smoking}*x_{smoking}+\beta_{pred.cancer}*x_{cancer} + \beta_{pred.age}*x_{age} +...}  $$
Where:

- $t$ = survival time
- $h_0(t)$ = the baseline hazard
- $\beta_{pred}$ = predictive hazard ratios for the exposures
- $x$ = the exposure. The exposure can be continuous (e.g. age) or categorical (e.g. smoking status). 

Categorical exposures are represented by dummy/factor variables. Each category has its own beta and the exposure is binary. For example smoking status is categorical variable with categories: current, former <= 5 years, former >5 years, or never smoked. For $\beta_{pred.current.smoker}$ the exposure: $x_{current.smoker}$ = 1 if the individual currently smokes or 0 if the individual is another type of smoker.


###Number of health outcomes

The number of health outcomes (e.g. summary - deaths) is calculated through the following steps:

1. Risk of the health outcome is calculated for each individual (row) in the data set using the mutlivariable predictive risk algorithm.
2. Each individual's (row) risk is weighted with their corresponding survey weight (CCHS PUMF = WTS_M and CCHS shared file = WTS_S).

$$ \text{Weighted risk of death } = \text{Individual's risk of death}*\text{Individual's survey weight}$$

3. The weighted mean of the health outcome (e.g. mean risk of death) is calculated.
4. The weighted mean is then multiplied with the total number of individuals in the population to generate the number of health outcomes (e.g. number of deaths in 5 years).


###Life expectancy

Life expectancy is calculated using abridge life tables *using a modified Chaing approach.(link to reference for Chiang and Hsieh and also one of our papers)*. Life expectancy is calculated by two methods: one for summary life expectancy, and a second for by row life expectancy.

####Summary Life Expectancy

Life expectancy is calculated separately for males and females. 

**Males:**

1. The mortality risk for each male individual is calculated using the male mortality mutlivariable predictive risk algorithm for mortality (MPoRT). Details about the MPoRT can be found in Appendix A.

2. Male individuals are grouped into the 5-year age groups that are used in the 5-year abridge life tables (e.g. 40-44 years old).

3. The weighted average risk of death for each age group is calculated. 

(Maybe modify this formula and put it in the number of health outcomes section?)
$$ \text{Weighted risk of death for age group} = \sum(\text{Weighted risk of deaths}) \div \text{Number of individuals in age group}$$

4. A male 5-year abridge life table is created using the weighted average risks of death (q(x)) for each age group and the median age for the age group. 


**Females**

Steps 1-4 used to calculate life expectancy for males, are repeated for females using the female MPoRT and a female 5-year abridge life table. 

**Summary life expectancy**

5. The summary life expectancy, or life expectancy of the entire population, is calculated by adding the male life expectancy with the female life expectancy, and taking its average.

**Summary life expectancy by strata**

Steps (1-4) are repeated for each strata. There will be strata specific weighted risk of death and strata specific life tables. 

Step 5 is repeated with the average life expectancy calculated across all strata.

####By row life expectancy

An individual's life expectancy is calculated by creating a new life table specific to that individual. 

These life tables are 1-year abridge life tables, and begin at the individual's age (e.g. an individual that is 43 years old, will have the life table start at 43 years). 

1. The probability of death for a person's current age is calculated using the respective MPoRT (male or female), and the individual's health profile (e.g. never smoked, 15 drinks weekly, has hypertension, is a Canadian Citizen, etc) (e.g. $q_x$, where $x=43$). 

2. The probability of death is recalculated for incremental older ages (additional rows of the life table) up to age 90 years ( $q_\text{(x+1)}, q_\text{(x+2)}...q_{90}$). For each life table row, age is the only variable that is changed for MPoRT risk calculation.

_Not sure what Doug is trying to get at here..._
<div class="FOO">
**Note:** Life expectancy calculation is for the respondent's age (eg. 43). To calculate age of death, add the respondent's age to their life expectancy estimate.
<div>

<div class="FOO">
**Note:** By row life expectancy does not account for the individual's weight, and therefore can not be used to estimate the summary life expectancy. 
<div>



##Scenario: Intervention

How would life expectancy change if everyone increased their physical activity levels by 10%?

The health intervention scenario allows you to predict how changing the health behaviours: alcohol consumption, diet, physical activity, and smoking, of a population will affect the population health outcome (e.g. life expectancy). This feature can be used to predict the effectiveness of proposed policies or programs.

There are three types of scenarios: **absolute, relative,** and **target**.

- **Absolute:** each individual in the population **changes** their health behaviour **by a value of x**. 
- **Relative:** each individual in the population **changes** their health behaviour **by a ratio of y**.
- **Target:** each individual in the population **has a set value of z.**

For target scenarios if the individual's value is already at the target value or beyond the target value then their value is not changed. E.g. If the target value for physical activity is 2.5 METs/day, then any individual that already has METs/day >= 2.5 METs/week then there value will not be adjusted.

The changes for each type of scenario for **alcohol, physical activity,** and **diet** are described in the following table:
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
(scenarios <- data.frame(
    Health.Behaviour = c(" ", "Alcohol Consumption", "Physical Activity", rep("Diet",3)),
    Absolute.change = c("Each individual changes ...", "the number of drinks they have per week by x", "their physical activity level by x METs per day", "the number of servings of fruits and vegetables they eat by x per day", "the number of glasses of juice they drink by x per week", "the number of servings of potatoes the eat by x per week"),
    Relative.change =c("Each individual changes ...", "the number of drinks they have per week by y %", "their physical activity level by y % METs per day", "the number servings of fruits and vegetables they eat by y % per day", "the number of glasses of juice by y % per day", "the number of potatoes they eat by y % per day"), 
    Target = c("Each individual has the value ...", "z drinks per week", "z METs per day", "z fruits and vegetables per day", "z glasses of juice per day", "z potatoes per day")
    ))#closingbracket 

```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Creating the table
kable(scenarios) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = T) %>%
  collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top") 
```


The **smoking** health intervention scenario is different then the other types of health intervention scenarios as they adjust the prevalence of the health behaviour. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
(scenarios.smoke <- data.frame(
    Health.Behaviour = c("Smoking"),
    Absolute.change = c("The prevalence of smokers decreases by x %"),
    Relative.change =c("The prevalence of smokers decreases by y %"), 
    Target = c("The prevalence of smokers is z %")
    ))#closingbracket 

```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Creating the table
kable(scenarios.smoke) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = T)
```

Although each type of health intervention for smoking: absolute, relative and target, changes the prevalence of current smokers they are different. The following figure shows how each is different from one another. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap= "Comparison of health intervention scenario types"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Scenario-Abs, Rel, Target cropped.jpg")
```

To adjust the prevalence of smokers, the change is applied to every current smoker in the population; individuals are not selected at random. ....





##Scenario: Cause-deleted

What would be the life expectancy of a population if be no one in the population ever smoked? This scenario is a cause-deleted scenario.

There are two distinct terms in cause-deleted calculations:

- **Cause-deleted life expectancy** is the estimated life expectancy for the counterfactual population where a specific cause (e.g. smoking) never existed. For instance, everyone in the counterfactual population were always never smokers.

- **Cause-deleted effect on life expectancy** or **life years lost due to the cause** is the full effect of the cause (e.g. smoking) in the population. For instance, 3 years of life are lost in a population due to individuals smoking: either currently or previously.

If multiple causes are selected (e.g. smoking and physical inactivity) the:

 - cause-deleted life expectancy calculated accounts for both of these effects 
 - cause-deleted effect on life expectancy (or life years lost due to the cause) is calculated for each individual cause. There will be both the cause-deleted effect of smoking on life expectancy and cause-deleted effect of physical inactivity on life expectancy.
 
<div class="FOO">
**Note:** $\text{Cause-deleted life expectancy of smoking and physical inactivity} \neq$
$\text{Cause-deleted effect of smoking} + \text{Cause-deleted effect of physical inactivity}$

This is because individuals in the population may be both smokers and physically inactive. 
</div>

###Cause-deleted references

The following table describes the reference exposures that are used for each of the cause-deleted scenarios:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
(cause.del.ref <- data.frame(
    Health.Behaviour = c("Smoking", "Alcohol Consumption", "Physical Activity", "Diet"),
    Reference = c("Never smoker", "0 drinks/week", "3.0 METs/day", "A total of: 5 fruit and vegetables, 0 juice, and 0 potato, servings/day")
    ))#closingbracket 

```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Creating the table
kable(cause.del.ref) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = T)
```
